# Docuburst

DocuBurst is the first visualization of document content which takes advantage of the human-created structure in lexical databases. We use an accepted design paradigm to generate visualizations which improve the usability and utility of WordNet as the backbone for document content visualization. A radial, space-filling layout of hyponymy (IS-A relation) is presented with interactive techniques of zoom, filter, and details-on-demand for the task of document visualization. The techniques can be generalized to multiple documents.

##How to run

`java -jar docuburst.jar my-plain-text-doc.txt` (requires Java 8+)

##Getting Started

1. Type the word you want to be the root of the tree. It defines the scope of your investigation. Not sure? Type *entity* for the broadest scope.
2. Go to *Options* and play with *Maximum tree depth*. It controls the level of detail of the view.
3. Now click *Single node* to color only the categories that occur *directly* in the document. 
4. Click on one of these categories and go to *Concordance lines* to see the excerpts where they appear in the text. *Text segments* is similar, but shows you more context.
5. By the way, the text is divided into segments based on vocabulary changes (check Mart Hearst's awesome [paper](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/papers/cl-texttiling97.pdf)). These segments are represented by tiles on the right side. When you click a category, the tiles where it appears become orange!
6. Pick a category of interest and double click it to narrow down your exploration.
7. Click+Hold+Move on a blank area to pan the view. RightClick+Hold+Move to zoom in/out.
8. Double RightClick on the root (center of the sunburst) to roll-up.
