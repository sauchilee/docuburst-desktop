DOCUBURST NOTES

[- note; . sub note; * to do; ? to consider; X to fix]

X DocuBurst ArrayList exception
* implement document pre-processor for DocuBurst: 
	create an XML file format which includes full text, a per-tile table for all synsets (indexed/load index)
* as Grame mentioned the line length of the text panels in DocuBurst is too long: new document browser?
* remove spinners, allow direct selection and direct indication of document subset included in vis
? connect a DocuBurst cell to the document vis with hover lines 
? click to highlight co-occurrences in a coordinated view
* select subtree
* show document title on background

- tried MapBackedDictionary, much slower
- tried FileBackedDictionary in new JWNL, also slower as relies on java.io.RandomAccessFile, which is much slower than the buffered IO I adapted the old one to use
- adapted new JWNL to use uio buffered IO

X refactor legend into it's own class; allow setting of colours, 2 scales (positive and negative)
X attenuate section brightness based on relative occurrence density

- tried two different text books with "science" in the title -- General Science and "Practice and Art of Drawing" and they looked almost the same!

10 December, 2008
- created 4 measures: EVEN, RANK, FIRST, FIRSTEVEN... seems like FIRST and FIRSTEVEN are the best; using actual probablities would be better: could distribute among highly likely
? perhaps the spread of the colour scale isn't wide enough?  Or it should change non-linearly
- "spread" verb and noun are highlighting the same paragraphs, and under "stuff", a focus search for "spread" yeild 0 even though it's there
? highlight occurring words with border if they aren't the first sense; don't propagate counts
X first layer of synsets not working: if central word root is in the doc, they appear as 0
- synset details and gloss should always be visible, not only on panel which is sometimes hidden
? add DLL against BNC as a scoring method?
? for FIRST scoring method, remove all synsets who have no member words for which it is the first synset (i.e. they will always be 0)
