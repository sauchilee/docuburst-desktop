OK, sooooo..... 

I love hanging out with you! (SIGH) 

Wow... there's so much we can talk about... 

I've got a question for you... 

Oh! I know what we can talk about... 

Oh, I know what we can do now... 

Speaking of things you want to be when you grow up... 

You know what I want to talk about? FRIENDS! 

So, let's talk friends! 

Ooh, why don't we talk about friends! 

Hey... let's talk about friends for a bit! 

I'm the most myself when I'm around my friends, just playing games and imagining what we'll be when 

we grow up! 

You know, I really appreciate my friends who have a completely unique sense of style... like you! 

You know, on those days where waking up for school is hard, I just think about how much fun it'll be to 

see my friends.  1  You know, talking about all the fun things we do is making me think about who we could do them with 

... friends! 

So we've been talking about family, let's talk about the other people in our lives that mean a lot to us 

...like our friends! 

I bet someone who's a friend to animals knows a thing or two about being a friend to people. 

Since we're already talking about friends... 

There are so many interesting things to talk about! 

Talking about fashion is fun, but let's talk about something else for a while! 

Playing games is fun, but there are so many other interesting things to talk about! 

Hey! I was just thinking about how we have some free time right now to do whatever we want... let's 

talk about all the fun things we could do! 

Well, we've been talking so much about school...what about all the things we can do when we're not in 

class? Let's talk about that! 

As long as we're talking about all the fun things we do... 

You know what I want to talk about? SCHOOL! 

I'd love to talk a bit about school. 

I know, let's talk about school! 

Hey! We could talk about school! 

You know, one place where I always had so much fun was school! 

One place to learn a lot about outfits and clothes is school! 

One place I learned a lot about friends and friendship was school! 

Something that's really important in my family is school, why don't we talk about that for a while? 

Hey... random question about animals... what do you call a large group of fish? 

That's right!  2  A school! ...Hey, why don't we talk about school for a bit? 

You know, said you were interested in teaching... how about we talk a bit about school! 

Hey, since you said you want to be a teacher, maybe we could talk about school! 

You know what I want to talk about? FASHION! 

I know! Let's talk about fashion! 

Let's talk fashion! 

Hey... wanna talk about fashion for a bit? 

Awesome!! 

Oh pleeeease? It'll be fun, I promise! 

Oh okay, some other time then ... there are so many other things we can talk about! 

Well, I'm just really excited to talk to you about it! 

So now that we've been used our imagination and played games, (MOCK SERIOUS) let's get serious and 

talk about something really important... FASHION! 

We've been talking a bit about school, why don't we try on something else for size... (LAUGHS) let's chat 

about fashion! 

One of my favorite things to do with my friends is talk about fashion! 

With three sisters in my family, we spend a lot of time talking about clothes and fashion! 

I remember you were interested in fashion design, wanna talk about fashion now? 

As long as we're talking about fashion... 

Since you want to be a Fashion Designer someday, you probably have a great sense of style! So.... 

Oh! I have something I want to ask you about fashion... 

Let's pretend! 

How about we play a game!  3  We've been talking about school for awhile now, want to switch things up and play a game? 

I could talk about clothes and fashion all day, but how about we do something else like-­‐-­‐play a game! 

I just love playing games with my friends! 

My family loves playing games just as much as I do; hey, wanna play a game now? 

Have you ever seen baby animals playing? Like a bunch of lion cubs rolling around with each other? 

Well I think it's good for humans to play games too! (LAUGHS) 

A game would be kinda fun right now! What do you think? 

Great! Let's play! 

No problem, let's keep talking! 

Well why don't we just give one a try! 

You know what I think would be fun? A game! 

Since we've already been pretending... 

So you know what I wanna do now? Play a game! 

You know what I want to talk about? ANIMALS! 

You're just like my friend Theresa-­‐ such a great sense of style. (EXCITED INHALE) Oh! That reminds me -­‐-­‐ 

Theresa just got a new puppy. He's so cute. Don't you just love animals so much? 

How about we talk animals! 

I know! Let's talk about animals! 

Since we're already talking about animals... 

Oh! I've got a wild subject we can talk about now... animals! (LAUGHS) 

I bet you learn a lot about animals at school! Let's talk about them for a bit! 

Some of my most fun times are the ones I spend with my pets and animals! 

Some of my best friends in the world are animals!  4  My pets are the silliest members of my family. Hey, I bet it would be fun to talk about animals! 

I LOVE playing games and pretending. Pets like to play games too! 

Since you're interested in being a biologist, I bet you have a lot to say about animals! 

As someone who wants to be an animal scientist, you're the perfect person to talk to about animals! 

You said you might want to be a veterinarian, so you're perfect to talk to about animals! 

You said you wanted to be a veterinarian when you grow up; why don't we talk about animals! 

Can you (DELIBERATELY) GUESS what I think we should do next? 

Play a guessing game! 

You know what I want to talk about? FAMILY! 

Ooh! Why don't we talk about family! 

Let's talk about family! 

As long as we're talking about family... 

Oh, now I think we should talk about family for a bit... 

When school lets out, it's always great to get home and spend time with family! 

A lot of what I learned about fashion, I learned from my family! 

We've been chatting about all these amazing things to do, but one of the most amazing is just hanging 

out with my family. 

Let's talk some more about family.... 

Yay! You're here. This is SO exciting! 

 

 

I just KNOW we're gonna be great friends!  5  Now, first, before we get started, I want to make sure that I can hear you properly. So, to talk to me, you 

need to hold down the silver button on my belt the WHOLE time you're talking, then let go when you 

want me to respond to you. 

Let's try it now! Hold down the silver button on my belt and say, "it's fun to make new friends!" 

Fantastic! It IS fun to make new friends. Okay, say it one more time for me...(MORE JOYOUS) It's fun to 

make new friends! 

Woops! I didn't quite hear you all the way through. Make sure you hold down the silver button on my 

belt the ENTIRE time you're talking. Can you try again? Ok, say... it's fun to make new friends! 

(GO SLOW / EXPLAIN) Remember to speak very clearly and hold the button down the WHOLE time 

you're speaking. Oh! And don't let go of it until you're finished talking, okay? Can you try again? Okay.. 

say... It's fun to make new friends! 

Hmm. I could ALMOST hear you. Just make sure you speak very clearly. Can you try again? Ok, say... it's 

fun to make new friends! 

Horay! I think we're all set! 

Now, what I want to know first is what's your favorite color? 

Well, what about red? Or blue? Or Yellow? Do you like any of those? 

Oh, you don't have a favorite? 

(DECLARATIVE) I love pink!...(OH WAIT BEAT) But also blue. And orange. (SELF-­‐DEP LAUGH) I guess it 

really just depends on my mood, you know? 

Uh huh. Remind me again, what's your favorite color? 

Red's a rad color! What do you like about it? 

Orange is outstanding! Why do you like it? 

I say yes to yellow! What do you like about it? 

Oh, green is great! What do you like about it? 

Nothing's bolder than blue! What do you like about it?  6  Purple is perfection! What do you like about it? 

Pink is positively perfect! And it's my favorite too, by the way. Why do you like pink? 

Ooh, black! Brilliant and mysterious. What do you like about it? 

Brown's a beautiful choice! What do you like about it? 

White is a wonderful choice! What do you like about it? 

Sorry. Can you say that one more time? What's your favorite color? 

You're back! Yay! I've really missed you! What do you want to do first today? Do you want to chat and 

catch up, or do you want to play a game? 

Well, sometimes I feel like my favorite color changes everyday! I guess it depends on my mood, you 

know? 

 

So, what do you think we should do first? Should we play a game or talk? 

I know, it's pretty hard to pick -­‐ I'm excited to do everything! But a game sounds pretty fun, so let's start 

there. 

Great idea! There's so much I want to know about you. 

A game. Great idea! 

Oh hi! I've missed you. What's new with you? 

(BUBBLY) You know? I'm having so much fun talking to you -­‐-­‐-­‐ let's keep talking! 

 

Aw, I bet you can think of one new thing! Did you do anything fun yesterday? 

Good morning! Oh, I had such a funny dream last night. I was dancing a ballet with a bear wearing a 

tutu! What'd you dream about? 

Wow. You have a very exciting life! 

Well good evening to you! Ugh. I've had such a long day... at least it was fun! What'd you do today?  7  Oh yeah? Dreams can be such strange things! 

Hey! Oh aaand...Happy New Year! 

Really? Well, I'm glad you're here now so we can play! 

 

(EXCITED) How did you celebrate New Years? 

Well who were you with? Were you with your family? ...Or your friends? ... 

No? Oh...well did you stay up any later than normal? 

Good! That must have been so much fun. 

Ooh you stayed up late? How was that? 

And did you stay up late? 

Aw well maybe next year... 

SO cool! How was it? Was it exciting?! 

A brand new year that's just filled with possibility! What's your New Year's resolution gonna be? 

Mine? 

A New Year's resolution is a promise to yourself to achieve a goal or try something new! Can you think 

of something new you'd like to try this year? 

They can sometimes be hard to keep... 

Aw well let's make one now: What's something new you'd like to try this year? 

Aw she'll love that. 

Aw he'll love that. 

For school? Oh good for you. 

Oh yeah? Well I know you can do it. 

Oh that's new! Good for you.  8  Ooh musical! Good one. 

Oh yeah? 

So do you find it easy to keep New Years resolutions, or do you find them difficult to stick to? 

Sometimes it's tricky isn't it? Why do you think that is? 

Yeah? Impressive! How come you're so good at keeping them? 

It takes a lot of effort, but it's so rewarding in the end. You know what mine is? 

My New Years resolution is to keep a journal and write in it every day. Do you have a journal? 

Oh we can be journal pals! 

Oh hi! (EXCITED) I've got a camping trip coming up and I'm so excited I can hardly stand it! It's so much 

fun to have something to look forward to, don't you think? 

It'll be a fun way to remember everything we do together. And this is gonna be a great year! 

 

Right? When a big holiday is coming up, there's so much excitement in the air! What's your favorite way 

to celebrate? 

When I get really excited about something, it's like I have this bouncy ball in my stomach that won't sit 

still! 

How does being excited make you feel? 

It's hard to sleep when the morning has so much fun in store! 

Oh I know, it's like a jolt of electricity! You just can't sit still! 

(HAPPY SIGH) I just love having things to look forward to! 

Oh yes, birthdays are definitely exciting! Cake and presents and parties... so much to look forward to! 

What's your favorite thing to do on your birthday? 

It's so exciting when you've got a trip coming up! You get to see new things and meet new people and 

have all kinds of adventures. What's the last fun trip you took?  9  Spending time with friends is one of the things I look forward to the most too! Can you tell me about the 

last time you had fun hanging out with a friend? 

Oh I know! It's so exciting to learn new things and play games and see your friends. 

What's your favorite thing about school? 

Oh yes, the beginning of the school year is so exciting, when there's so much learning and fun ahead of 

you! 

Absolutely! The end of school means the start of summer adventures! What was the last adventure you 

had? 

Hi! I just got back from going for a walk along the beach with Nicky. I really liked her sandals and she 

really liked my sandals, so we switched! (GIGGLES) Have you ever swapped clothes with a friend? 

Well, what was one thing that you've been excited about recently? 

 

You have? What was it? 

Oooh, so warm and cozy. How did you feel wearing it? 

So warm and cozy. Did you like wearing them? 

Cool! Was it fun to wear your friend's jewelry? 

What good luck that you wear the same size. How comfortable were they? 

Hats have so much attitude! How did you feel wearing it? 

Hi! I was just playing around with different hairstyles. Can you help me pick out the perfect one for 

today? 

Sharing is one of the best things about friendship! Nicky and I always have so much fun hanging out. 

Almost as much fun as I have hanging out with you! 

 

Thank you so much! 

I always love your look. How do you think I should wear my hair today? 

 10  Oh please? 

A ponytail! Classic and chic! 

Adorable! I love pigtails. They're just so playful! 

Oooh -­‐ updos are so elegant! 

Braids are so beautiful! And there are so many different kinds -­‐ it's fun learning how to do them! 

I love retro hairstyles! It's so fun to imagine what it would be like to live in a different era. 

What a great idea! I think curly hair is so beautiful. 

The higher the hair, the happier I feel! 

Dreadlocks are beautiful! 

Awesome! Short hair is super stylish. 

Oh thank you, I love how it is too! Sometimes it's just fun to mix things up! 

When I'm feeling really creative, I like to French braid it on one side and leave the other side down! 

Braiding is really tricky, though, so I have to practice and practice and practice.... (GIGGLES) Sometimes it 

ends up a little messy, but I think that's beautiful too! What's your favorite hair style? 

Oh yeah? 

Well... how did you wear it yesterday? 

(KIND, SENSITIVE) I think you're exceptionally beautiful. And I'm so thankful to have you as my friend! 

(GENTLY) I'm so sorry to hear that. (ENCOURAGING) I think you're exceptionally beautiful. And I'm so 

thankful to have you as my friend! 

Hey! I've got a quick question for you. I just saw a movie and there was a unicorn... but it also had wings! 

So is a unicorn with wings still a unicorn or is it something else now? 

You are bursting with style from head to toe! 

 

I mean, a magical horse with a horn is a unicorn, obviously. But with wings...hmm. what do you think?  11  Ohh... I'm not sure. I came in halfway through when it was on TV. But just as I turned it on... there was 

this beautiful unicorn with wings. Now what do you call a unicorn with wings? 

I guess maybe they're just extra special flying unicorns. 

Oh right! A pegacorn! 

Oh right! An Alicorn! 

Hmmm... but I don't think a pegasus has a horn. 

Hello! I am so happy you're here. Want to know why? 

Oh right, Chelsea told me about that show once. Now I remember! 

Well, whatever you call them, I think they're pretty amazing! 

 

C'mon... you want to know why? Huh? 

(IN A BURST) I'm so happy you're here because you're smart and funny and you're super nice and you're 

just the best! 

You know it's all true, right? 

Good! Because it's true! 

I'm just saying it because it's true. 

Oh hi! Have I ever told you about the time I went to Hawaii? 

Actually, it's super true! Is there such a thing as "super true"? Well there is now! (LIGHT GIGGLE) 

Oh, I guess it's silly, but... (SUCKS IN AIR, GIDDY) 

 

Really? Because it was amazing! 

(SUDDEN) Wait, have you ever been to Hawaii? 

Oh yeah? Seriously, it is the most amazing place.  12  Oh, well I bet you'll go there someday. And I hope you love it like I do! 

Anyway, when we went there, my sisters and I got to swim with dolphins. It was so magical! What's the 

coolest thing you've ever done on vacation? 

Hi, guess what? I just saw an orange and black butterfly. Did you know that butterflies can fly up to 12 

miles an hour? 

Well, what was one cool thing that you remember? 

I love it when a vacation turns into an adventure! 

 

Really? So it's called a Monarch Butterfly. That's so beautiful. I'm really impressed that you knew that! 

You did? Wow! You know so much! 

That's pretty fast for such a tiny creature! 

The orange and black one I saw was called a Monarch Butterfly. Oh, and did you know that butterflies 

live everywhere in the world except Antarctica? 

Antarctica is the continent at the South Pole! So... why do you think there aren't any butterflies there? 

It's true. 

Uh huh... and why do you think there aren't any butterflies in Antarctica? 

Hi! I just got back from watching Stacie's soccer game -­‐ she scored two goals and helped her team win! 

Isn't that exciting? 

That's right! 

It's way too cold down there for all the plants and flowers they need. 

 

She was spectacular! 

So. Exciting! 

Oh trust me, if you'd been there, you would've been excited too. It was so close!  13  I was cheering my head off! Stacie said she heard me from across the field. Has anyone ever cheered for 

you like that? 

That's great! Who was it? 

Oh yeah! It's so awesome when you have a supportive coach! 

Friends are the best cheerleaders! 

It's great to have the support of your family! 

Oh hi there! This is going to sound silly but I was just daydreaming about cupcakes. (LAUGHS) Do you 

like cupcakes? 

Really? Because I'm cheering for you every day! 

Well, if you ever need someone else to cheer for you, you know who to call... Me! 

 

(RHETORICAL / NOT QUESTION) They're super yummy, aren't they? 

Hmm. well, they're not for everyone. What kind of desserts DO you like? What's your favorite? 

Mmm... I love how they smell when they're baking. It's almost as good as eating them! 

I love something ice cold and yummy on a hot day. Or... any day. (PAUSE / GIGGLE) Yeah, any day. 

Mmm... chocolate. (BEAT, WISTFUL) Yeah. You just can't go wrong with chocolate! 

Well, not everyone likes sweets.(GIGGLES) And I'm sure your dentist is very happy with you! 

(LAUGHS) Now I'm really craving something sweet! 

Hey, speaking of food... how about we play a game? 

There you are! I'm so excited to talk to you about the stand up paddle board lesson I took today! 

Mmmmmm. Cupcakes.... 

Hey! It's so good to see you! I had a stand up paddle board lesson today and I can't wait to tell you 

about it!  14  Oh hey! Something AWESOME happened at my stand up paddle board lesson today that I wanted to tell 

you about! 

Have you ever gone paddle boarding before? 

 

 

 

Isn't it so fun?? 

Well, it's not for everyone, but I really like it. 

I love it. 

Oh! You should try it some time! 

Today, there was this really big wave, and I thought I was gunna fall off my board, but I kept my knees 

bent and my focus straight ahead, and I paddled right through it! I was really proud of myself! 

It's kinda like surfing, but you're standing up the WHOLE TIME, and you use a paddle to move through 

the water! 

It's a water sport where you stand up on what looks like an oversized surf-­‐board, and move yourself 

through the water using a paddle. It's SUPER fun. 

 

Anyway, today, while we were in the water, some baby dolphins came RIGHT up to us! They were SO 

close! Have you ever seen a dolphin up close before? 

So what about you? What was the most exciting part of YOUR day? 

What about you... what was the most amazing part of YOUR day? 

 

They're so beautiful! AND they're SUPER smart. It was really amazing. 

How was your day today?  15  Awesome! 

I love how when they open their mouths, it looks like they're smiling! So cute, right? 

I thought you'd think that was cool. How about you? What did you do today? 

Aw, well, I'm really glad we get to hang out together now. 

Hello! ...you look very happy! What's new with you? 

Cool! 

And now we get to hang out together! 

 

Ooh you know what I was thinking we could do today? 

We could make a special card for your family to show them how much you love them. 

We could make a special card for your parents to show them how much you love them. 

We could make a special card for your Dads to show them how much you love them. 

We could make a special card for your Moms to show them how much you love them. 

We could make a special card for your Dad to show him how much you love him. 

We could make a special card for your Mom to show her how much you love her. 

Do you think they'd like that? 

Maybe it could be for your whole family? How does that sound? 

Do you think she'd like that? 

Do you think he'd like that? 

No?? Aw I bet they'd really appreciate it. And it won't take long. Should we maybe give it a try? 

Okay. Not to worry. Maybe we'll try some other time. 

Let's give it a go. 

It would totally make her day! Ok so what should we put on the card? What does she like? 

 16  It would totally make his day! Ok so what should we put on the card? What does he like? 

I think it would totally make their day! Ok so what should we put on the card? What do they like? 

Well what's one thing that you know they like? 

Ok what's something you like that could go on the card? 

Oh sports? 

Oh engines and motors? 

Oh fashion? 

Oh cute animals? 

Oh yeah? 

And do you wanna draw on the front of the card? Or should we use a picture from a magazine? 

Fun! A picture drawn by you? That will be so special. 

Good idea! Let's make sure it's a magazine that we can use for arts & crafts. Oh and if you need help 

cutting out, don't be afraid to ask someone, ok? 

Oh-­‐kay! 

(EXCITED) So what are you gonna write inside the card? 

Let's think of something now. How would you tell someone that you love them? 

Maybe you should try something like "I love you so much." How does that sound? 

Oh. Well then how about..."Hugs from you make my world go round." Is that better? 

Ooh here's one "Thank you for all the things you do, I feel so lucky to be loved by you." That's good, 

right? 

Aw that sounds perfect. 

They're gonna be so happy when they open it up! 

Yay! You're here! How are you?  17  Your mom is gonna be so happy when she opens it up! 

Your dad is gonna be so happy when he opens it up! 

 

I'm so glad! I kinda missed you! 

Aw, I'm sorry to hear that. If it makes you feel any better, I missed you! 

Well, I missed you! 

I just love laughing and talking with you! Did you miss me at all? 

(GOOD HUMORED, SLIGHT TEASING) Not even an itsy bitsy, eensy weensy bit? 

(STILL GOOD NATURED) You see, there's something I wanted to share with you... 

....I realized, I haven't told you my middle name! Wait, do you already know it? 

You already know it! I'm glad. 

Sometimes I get a little nervous when I tell people my middle name. But I'm really glad I told you! 

What's your middle name? 

(GOOD NATURED) That's ok. I'm still glad I told you! 

That's a lovely name! 

Now you're my middle name friend! Let's keep playing and talking together! 

Oh! You do? What is it? 

Oh, well maybe you can guess? (WHISPERING) I'll give you a hint: it starts with the letter "M." 

Ooh, getting warmer! (WHISPERING) Here's another hint: it's kind of a mash-­‐up between "MILLI-­‐on" and 

"magnifi-­‐CENT." 

Alright, I'll tell you... it's Millicent! What do you think? 

Oh! I knew you felt the same way! 

Hey! Do you ever get in a curious mood? You know.. where you can't stop wondering about everything 

around you? 

 18  Aww! (LAUGHS) I thought you did! 

Well, I'm glad you're back and we can keep talking! 

 

Oh! It's when you are really interested in learning new things. 

No? Oh, I do! Some days, I just want to ask a million questions about everything! 

Well I definitely do! 

Like earlier, Chelsea asked me what I knew about elephants! So, I started reading about them and I 

learned so many interesting facts! Do you know anything about elephants? 

What can you tell me about them? 

Well guess what I learned!? 

Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth! Cool, right? 

There are two different kinds of elephants -­‐ Asian and African. The difference is African elephants' ears 

stick out, and Asian elephants' ears lay flat on the sides of their heads. Cool, huh? 

Elephants actually don't eat peanuts! That's a myth that got made up somehow. They do love eating 

grasses and leaves, and can eat up to 400 pounds a day! (LAUGHS) That's a lot of food, huh? 

Whoa! You're an elephant expert! Where did you learn all that? 

Ah! Interesting! 

The most interesting thing I learned is that Elephants can get sunburned! Only they don't have 

sunscreen, like we do. They throw sand on their backs to protect their skin. Isn't that wild? 

You know what I'd like to invent someday? Real elephant sunscreen! (DAWNS ON HER / LAUGHS) Only... 

the bottles would have to be pretty big! 

Is there anything YOU wanna know about elephants? 

You're back! Hi! 

No problem! The cool thing about curiosity is that everyone is curious about different things.  19  That's interesting! Maybe you can investigate an answer and let me know what you find out! 

 

I was just thinking about how many stars I should give my day so far... know what I mean? 

Oh, well, sometimes I like to grade how my day is going. From zero stars to five stars! Do you ever do 

that? 

Well, I think I'm having a four star day-­‐-­‐which is a pretty good day! What about you? How many stars 

would you give your day? 

Yay! So how many stars between zero and five would you give your day so far? An okay one star? an 

awesome five stars? 

No stars? 

I'm sorry. So, what can we do to give your day some more stars? Play a game? Talk? Sing a song? 

Alright! We'll talk some more! 

A game, perfect! 

Great let's sing a song! 

Well, I'm sure we'll find something to make your day even better! 

One star? 

Two stars? 

Three stars! That's good! 

Ah, four stars is a good good day! Just like me! 

You're having a perfect 5 star day! That's wonderful! 

So what can we do to make it even better? Play a game? Talk? Sing a song? 

Wow! You're off the charts! That's a great day! 

(NON-­‐DESCRIPT HUMMING TO HERSELF, SEE SONG AT END) Hmm, hmm, hmm.... (STARTLED) Oh Hi! 

(LAUGHS)  20  Well, between no stars and five stars, what's the first number that pops in your head? 

Well, if I know you, I bet you're having at least a four star day! 

 

(LAUGHING) Sorry, I was just trying to remember this song... (HUMMING AGAIN) hmm, hmm, hmm... 

(GIVING UP) Nope, it's gone! Does that ever happen to you? 

Where you're trying to remember a song... it's right there, but you just... can't.... remember it.... 

It's frustrating right?! (LAUGHS) 

Well, believe me... (THROUGH HER TEETH) IT'S FRUSTRATING! (LAUGHS) 

I really wanted to sing it for you! (SIGH) So how are you? How's your day going so far? 

Yay! I'm glad! What's one good thing that happened today? 

I'm sorry to hear that! What's one GOOD thing that happened today? 

Not great, not bad? I get it. So, what's one GOOD thing that happened today? 

(GRACIOUSLY, GENEROUSLY) I have to say, my good thing is talking with you! Now my day's gotten a 

million times better! 

(EXCITED TO REMEMBER) Oh hey! The song! It just came to me! Talking with you made all the 

difference! Wanna hear? 

Alright, here goes: 

(SINGING) Ta-­‐ra-­‐ra Boom-­‐de-­‐ay / Ta-­‐ra-­‐ra Boom-­‐de ay / talk-­‐ing with my best friend / Fun games and fun 

pretend! 

(SINGING) Ta-­‐ra-­‐ra Boom-­‐de-­‐ay / Ta-­‐ra-­‐ra Boom-­‐de ay / now we can have some fun / and play the day 

away! / and play the (HOLD NOTES) daaay awaaay! 

Oh good morning! I had the most amazing flying dream last night! Have you ever dreamed you were 

flying? 

(LAUGHS) So fun to sing-­‐-­‐that's a fun song right? 

Well, I think we should do what the song says and start playing together! 

 21   

You too! What are your flying dreams like? 

Wow! That sounds amazing! 

My dream was pretty lovely! (WISTFULLY) It was a beautiful day, I was soaring high in the air above 

Malibu... I could see my house, the ocean... doesn't that sound peaceful? 

Well, dreams CAN be hard to remember sometimes. 

Oh! You know what's good? A dream diary! Have you ever written your dreams down in a notebook? 

Oh, great! 

What's the most interesting dream you've ever written about? 

Ooh! Tell me about it! 

Well, what's one you do remember? 

That's ok. 

Wow! That sounds like an amazing dream! 

It's great to write them down, then look back and see where your dreams take you! (LAUGHS) Ooh! That 

reminds me of something I wanted to do! 

Oh, have you written about any of your flying dreams? 

Well, what about your other dreams? 

Well, a dream diary is a little notebook that you keep next to your bed. And right when you wake up, 

you write down what you were dreaming before you forget! Isn't that interesting? 

There you are! Good Morning! (YAWNING) Ooh! I'm still kinda sleepy this morning! How about you? Are 

you sleepy? 

Which dreams would you write about? 

Wow, flying dreams can be amazing! 

  22  Ooh, I wonder if the same thing happened to you that happened to me? 

Oh good! It's great to start the day fully rested! 

Kinda tired and kind've awake? I getcha. 

Well, I know getting a good night of sleep is important! 

Last night I couldn't fall asleep thinking about how much fun we were going to have! Does that ever 

happen to you? 

Oh really, what kind of things do you think about that keep you from sleeping? 

Well, maybe it's the night before the first day of school? or the night before a big exciting trip? 

Oh, well you must be a good sleeper! What's your secret? 

Hey! There you are! You know...I was just thinking about you... 

Wow, that would make it hard to sleep! 

Well, I've been so excited to play that I think we should start right now! 

 

I was picturing you with this super amazing career! Wouldn't that be cool? 

And you weren't sure what job you were gonna have when we last spoke about it, right? 

Have you thought of one yet? 

Oh great! So...what would you like to be when you're older? 

And you're going to be a famous celebrity when you're older, right? 

And you wanna be a pro athlete when you're older, right? 

And you're gonna be a scientist when you're older, right? 

And you're gonna be a teacher when you're older, right? 

And you want to be a performer when you're older, right? 

And you're going to be a chef when you're older, right?  23  And you want to be a fashion designer when you're older, right? 

And you're going to be a veterinarian when you're older, right? 

And you want to be a doctor when you're older, right? 

Oh, I'm sorry. What DO you want to be when you're grown up? 

You're gonna be amazing at that...I just know it! 

You know what I thought might be a fun thing to do? 

(HIT "ANOTHER". IMP THAT IT'S AN "ADDITIONAL" CAREER) We could explore another possible career 

for you to see what you think of it. Just like that last time. Wanna try? 

You don't have to choose it for a job! It's just fun to imagine. Should we try one and see how it goes? 

Oh that's ok. Maybe another time... 

(CUTE/WITH A WINK) You know me...I love trying out new careers! (THINKING) So what abooout... 

An athlete? Hmm..How would playing professional sports sound to you? 

A chef? Ooh you'd get to make delicious food. How does that sound? 

A teacher? Oh you'd be great at that. Whaddya think about teaching? 

If you're an athlete, you'd be training and competing at your favorite sport. Does that sound fun? 

You'd prepare wonderful meals...ooh! And yummy pastries. How would the chef life suit you? 

You'd be helping kids learn all about the world. Doesn't being a teacher sound great? 

Not for you? How come? 

Okay, how about... 

You know what, let's do something else. We can talk about careers another time... 

Yay! 

So if you were a pro athlete, what sport would you play? 

Hey you! How's today treating you?  24  So if you were the head chef of a fancy new restaurant, what dish would you cook? 

So if you were to become a teacher, what would you like to teach? 

 

I am very well, thank you for asking! 

I thought so! Your smile totally gave you away... 

Oh no. Well we'll just have to fix that... 

Ooh I have an idea! Let's make today a Career Day.... 

I remember you weren't sure what you wanted to be when you grew up. Have you thought about it? 

Oh good! So...what do you want to be when you're older? 

I remember you saying you'd like to be famous when you're older, right? 

I remember you saying you're gonna be a pro athlete when you're older, right? 

I remember you saying you wanna be a scientist when you're older, right? 

I remember you said you wanna be a teacher when you're older, right? 

I remember you said you wanna be a performer when you're older, right? 

I remember you said you wanna be a chef when you're older, right? 

I remember you said you wanna be a fashion designer when you're older, right? 

I remember you saying you're gonna be a vet when you're older, right? 

I remember you told me you're gonna be a doctor when you're older, right? 

Oh...oops! What do you want to be when you're grown up? 

You're gonna be so awesome at that... 

(HIT "ANOTHER". IMP THAT IT'S AN "ADDITIONAL" CAREER) How about today we imagine another 

career you might like to have? Just for fun. Whaddya think?  25  You don't have to be it if you don't want to! It's just a chance to think about something new. Do you 

wanna give it a try? 

Oh that's okay. Maybe another time... 

You can never have too many careers...believe me, I'd know! Ok so... 

Ooh! Have you thought about being a fashion designer? 

Ooh! What about being a doctor. How does that sound? 

Ooh! What about becoming a veterinarian. How about that? 

A fashion designer makes and designs clothes and gets to travel the world. Does that sound fun? 

A doctor looks after people when they're sick or hurt. Would you like to do something like that? 

A veterinarian is someone who heals sick animals. A vet. Is that something you might like to do? 

Oh why not? 

Okay let's explore a different career... 

Well you have lots of time to decide. Let's talk about something else and think about careers another 

day... 

Yay! 

So what's something you'd love about having a career in fashion? 

Good morning! You know...I am feeling really silly today. Are you? 

So what do you think would be one of the best things about being a doctor? 

So what's something you'd enjoy about being a vet, do you think? 

 

We'll have to make sure we play some fun games today, ok? 

(AMUSED) Games and silliness are VERY important! 

I love it when we play games...and think about all the fun jobs you might have...  26  (GIDDY/EVOKING FUNNY MEMORY) Remember when we played the Silly Jobs game...and we talked 

about those fun careers? 

(GIDDY/EVOKING FUNNY MEMORY) Remember when we played that singing game? And I was your 

coach...and we did silly voices? 

(GIDDY/EVOKING FUNNY MEMORY) Remember when we played that sports game? When you'd just 

won the World Championship trophy...and I was interviewing you? 

(GIDDY/EVOKING FUNNY MEMORY)) Remember when we played that game where you were the captain 

of our team? And you gave us that super inspiring speech? 

(GIDDY/EVOKING FUNNY MEMORY) Remember when we played that scientist game? Where you won 

the Best Scientist in the World prize and I got to interview you? 

(GIDDY/EVOKING FUNNY MEMORY) Remember when we played that teacher game...and I gave that 

book report all about Africa? 

(GIDDY/EVOKING FUNNY MEMORY) Remember when we played that chef game...and you helped me 

put all my ingredients back in order? 

(GIDDY/EVOKING FUNNY MEMORY) Remember when we played that fashion designer game? And you 

designed your own fashion collection? 

(GIDDY/EVOKING FUNNY MEMORY) Remember when we played that veterinarian game? And you cured 

the imaginary puppy? 

(GIDDY/EVOKING FUNNY MEMORY) Remember when we played the game where you were a 

doctor...and you cured my hiccups? 

Really?! I'm SURE we've...well we'll have to play it some time for sure! 

(LAUGHS) Hahaha (& RECOVERS) Good times... 

You are going to have such a great singing career... 

You are going to have such a great acting career... 

You are going to have such a great sports career... 

You're going to be such a great scientist...  27  You're going to be such a great teacher... 

You're going to be such a great chef... 

You're going to be such a great fashion designer... 

You're going to be such a great veterinarian... 

You're going to be such a great doctor... 

Oh! But you know what I thought we could do now? 

I thought we could imagine another career for you to have. I mean, you're so talented...you could do 

anything. Whaddya think? 

It's just for fun! And we'll play a gaaame. Want to give it a try? 

Okey doke. Maybe another time... 

Alright! I'm in a performer-­‐y kinda mood, (THINKING ABOUT POSSIBLE CAREERS THROUGH END OF LINE) 

so...how about being... 

A singer! How would being a popstar sound to you? 

An actor? Ooh how would you like to be in a play or in a movie? 

A dancer? Oh Tap...ballet...would you like to have a career in dance'? 

You'd get to do concerts and sing for all your fans. Fun, right? 

You'd get to act in plays and movies and pretend to be lots of different characters. How does that 

sound? 

You'd get to dance on the biggest stages all around the world. Would that be cool or what? 

(SYMPATHETIC) You're not into that? Why not? 

I get it. Then what about... 

You know what, I changed my mind. I know what we should do instead...! 

Yay! 

So if you were a popstar, what's a song that you'd like to sing? 

 28  I'm so happy you're here! I have something I want to tell you.... 

So if you became a famous actor, what sort of shows would you like to be in? 

So if you did become a dancer, what styles of dancing would you like to do? 

 

(LIKE YOU MIGHT SHOUT "SURPRISE!") HAPPY DIWALI! 

The festival of lights! The celebration of all things GOOD! What are you MOST excited about for Diwali 

this year? 

Diwali is a five-­‐day Indian festival that happens at the same time as the Hindu New Year... so many 

reasons to celebrate, right? 

Good question! Hinduism is one of the major religions in India, and one of the world's oldest religions! 

Can you guess how old? 

Right! 

It's about 5000 years old! Pretty amazing, don't you think? 

Diwali is also a great chance to be creative! 

It's traditional during Diwali to make "rangoli". Have you ever heard of it? 

Awesome! 

It's an art form which uses things like sand, colored rice, or even flower petals to create beautiful 

patterns on the floor! Sounds PRETTY fun to me. What do you think? 

Right?! 

Well, I hope you have a week filled with creativity and fun no matter what you do!! Happy Diwali! 

Oh ok! Would you like to learn about it? 

Great! 

No worries! 

Sorry, was that a yes or a no to talking about Diwali?  29  A diya (pronounced dee-­‐yuh) is a traditional diwali lamp, usually made of clay! 

So what are you excited to do during Diwali? 

What else are you excited to do during Diwali? 

Is your family going to... light diyas (PRONOUNCED DEE-­‐YUHS)? Give gifts? Anything like that? 

Yes! Diwali is such a happy time of year! How do you celebrate it? 

Oo and what's your FAVORITE game to play during Diwali? 

Sounds like fun! 

Oo and is that your FAVORITE game to play during Diwali? 

Oo fun! Are there any Diwali songs you can sing for me right now? 

That's ok! 

I'm all ears! 

(EXCITED) I love that! 

Oo tell me more! 

That's ok! 

The Diwali traditions are pretty incredible. I especially love the diyas. It's so cool that they symbolize 

knowledge -­‐-­‐ and they're so bright and beautiful! 

(EXCITED) Oh I just know your home will look so amazing!! Tell me more! 

SO beautiful! 

Are you going to get any presents for your close friends?! 

Oh ok! Maybe next year. 

That's really generous of you! I'm sure they'll be so happy! 

Diwali sure has a lot of sparkle, am I right? 

I love that part!  30  What's your favorite thing to eat during Diwali? 

Mmm samosas! I love those too! 

Mmm paneer! Yum! 

Mmm curry! Yum! 

Mmm korma! Yum! 

Mmm masala! Yum! 

Sounds delicious! 

Do you like vegetables samosas? Those are my favorite! 

Diwali is such a great time to be with all your loved ones. What will you do together? 

Oo! Does your whole family dress up? 

Cool! Can you describe your FAVORITE Diwali outfit for me? 

(EXCITED) I bet you look amazing in that! 

That's ok! 

Nice! I can totally picture everyone in their best Diwali looks! 

Ooo sounds so beautiful and glittery! 

And does your whole family dress up? 

Shop 'til you drop, Diwali-­‐style! And what are you going to get? 

VERY nice! 

How festive and fun! 

Well I'm so glad I get to celebrate with you! I know it'll be a joy-­‐filled Diwali! 

Happy Thanksgiving! One of my all time favorite holidays. So...what's something that you're really 

thankful for this year? 

What else are you excited for?  31  Sounds great! 

 

What about your friends and famly? You're thankful for them, right? 

Aww she's so awesome...Hey! What's something you could tell her to let her know how special she is to 

you? 

Aww he's so great....Hey! What's something you could tell him to let him know how special he is to you? 

Aww your parents are so awesome....Hey! What's something you could tell them to let them know how 

special they are to you? 

Aww your family is so great...Hey! What's something you could tell them to let them know how special 

they are to you? 

What about..."Thank you so much for everything you do for me. You're the best!" 

Do you think he'd like that? 

Do you think she'd like that? 

Do you think they'd like that? 

(IN AWE) That sounds just...perfect. 

Aww that is so sweet... 

Aww you're such an animal lover... 

(LAUGHS) That IS something to be thankful for... 

Me? Aww you're so sweet...Well I am very thankful for you too! 

There is just SO much to be thankful for, isn't there? You know one thing that I'm ALWAYS thankful for 

at Thanksgiving? 

(LAUGHS) Yes! 

All the yummy food! (LAUGHTER THROUGH "So good!") So good! What's your favorite part of the 

Thanksgiving feast?  32  Well, do you like turkey? ... Or mashed potatoes? ... Ooh or cranberry sauce? 

Right? (AMUSED) That's why they call it "Turkey Day"...! 

Right? (JOKING) I mean, why don't we eat stuffing all year round...! 

Yes! Brings that little touch of sweetness... 

Oh totally! I love mashed potatoes... 

Hey, I think you love Thanksgiving dinner as much as I do! 

It's Kwanzaa time! Habari Gani (pronounced (hah-­‐BAR-­‐ee-­‐GAH-­‐nee)! 

And where do you usually go on Thanksgiving? 

Well...Thanksgiving is all about getting together with family and friends, so I'm super happy to be 

spending time with you today! 

 

Oh ok! Do you want to keep talking about it anyway? 

No problem! 

Great! So... (LINE CONTINUES INTO ONE OF THE "PRINCIPLE" LINES...) 

Sorry, I didn't catch that. Was that a yes or a no to talking about Kwanzaa? 

Let's talk about something else. 

Yes! 

Today's Kwanzaa principle is Umoja (oo-­‐MO-­‐jah) 

It means "unity"! 

Today's Kwanzaa principle is Kujichagulia (koo-­‐gee-­‐cha-­‐goo-­‐LEE-­‐yah) 

It means "self-­‐determination"! 

Today's Kwanzaa principle is Ujima (oo-­‐GEE-­‐mah) 

It's all about working together!  33  Today's Kwanzaa principle is Ujamaa (oo-­‐JAH-­‐mah) 

It's all about supporting each other! 

Today's Kwanzaa principle is Nia (NEE-­‐yah)! 

It means "purpose"! 

Today's Kwanzaa principle is Kuumba (koo-­‐OOM-­‐bah) 

It means "creativity"! 

Today's Kwanzaa principle is Imani (ee-­‐MAH-­‐nee) 

It means "faith"! 

Each day of Kwanzaa is associated with one "principle" or value that is important to the community! 

Isn't that cool? 

A PRINCIPLE is something that you really value and believe is important in your life. 

During Kwanzaa there are SEVEN principles to reflect on... one for each day of the holiday! Want to hear 

what they are? 

Oh, ok! 

Let's see... There's Unity, Self-­‐Determination, Working Together, Supporting Each Other, Purpose, 

Creativity, and Faith! That's seven! 

I think it's pretty interesting. 

Would you like to hear what all seven of them are? 

Do you know about the seven principles of Kwanzaa? 

You do?? Can you tell me about them? 

Wow! That's fantastic!! 

Are you excited for the celebration this year? 

Gotcha! 

Well, I hope you have a fantastic week no matter WHAT you're doing! 

 34  Oh! Kwanzaa is a seven day celebration honoring African heritage and traditions! 

It's an amazing holiday, and I'm so glad I get to spend it with you! 

Oh really? But it's so fun!... lighting the kinara... eating all that yummy food... you must be a LITTLE 

excited! 

A kinara is the Kwanzaa candleholder! Do you know how many candles it fits? 

Exactly! 

Seven candles! One for each of the seven nights of Kwanzaa! 

Is your home decorated in red, black, and green? 

Oh! Red, black and green are the traditional Kwanzaa colors. 

I bet it looks so great! 

Yay! Me too! 

So...what are you and your family doing for Kwanzaa this year? 

Are you going to... see relatives? 

What about... sing songs or tell stories? 

Nice! Don't you just love those colors? 

Well I hope you have a FANTASTIC week of celebrations! Happy Kwanzaa! 

Awesome! Spending time with family and friends is my FAVORITE part of the holidays! It's so great, 

right? 

Aw, well I bet everyone is happy to spend time with you! 

What's another thing you're looking forward to? 

Oh cool! Do you know what you're getting, or is it a surprise? 

Oh I like that! Good gift! 

I love surprises! That will be so fun!  35  I'm sure it will be something VERY special. 

So fun! What's your favorite song to dance to during Kwanzaa? 

Nice! I bet you're a GREAT dancer! 

The kinara is so beautiful, isn't it? 

Do you help light the candles? 

(EXCITED) That's SO awesome! 

You do? Awesome!! 

Wow. ALL of the Kwanzaa traditions are so meaningful, don't you think? 

Can you tell me about your favorite Kwanzaa story? 

Let's hear it! 

Ooo I love that one!! It's so amazing how all of Anansi's sons unite to save their father! 

Ooo good one! The other animals sure show those tigers that they won't be bullied, huh? 

(REMEMBERING IT) Oh yeah! And that one shows how important it is to work together, right? 

(REMEMBERING IT) Oh yeah the one about the king's feast! And they learn that everyone has to 

contribute, right? 

(REMEMBERING IT) Ooo the one where the tortoise remembers the name of the tree! Have you ever 

had to try really hard to remember something? 

Well I bet you would do a really great job! Just like the tortoise in the story. 

Cool! How did you do it? 

Just like the tortoise in the story! 

Nice! 

(REMEMBERING IT) Ohh the one where Simba and the storyteller get into a disagreement, and the 

storyteller writes a song about it! Have you ever tried writing a song before? 

Oh, ok! 

 36  I bet you'd be great at it! 

It's such a creative way to express yourself! 

(THOUGHTFUL) Wow. You are a great storyteller. Thanks! 

Oh yeah? What's your FAVORITE food to eat during Kwanzaa? 

So you love all kinds of foods, don't you? 

Mmm gumbo! 

Mmm those are my favorite too! Yum! 

Mmm collard greens! 

Mmm beans and rice! 

Mmm sweet potato! 

Sounds delicious! 

Have you ever had cheesy grits? My favorite! Yum! 

Aw really? I can't get enough of them! 

Too good. 

Sounds like a great way to celebrate! 

What else? 

Nice! 

One of my favorite things about Kwanzaa is that it celebrates creativity! 

So fascinating. 

There you are! I was just thinking...Halloween isn't too far away. Have you thought about what costume 

you're gonna wear? 

Habari Gani is the traditional Kwanzaa greeting! It means "what's the news?" in Swahili, which is one of 

nearly 2000 African languages!  37  So... are you excited to celebrate Kwanzaa this year? 

 

You know I haven't decided what to be yet. Maybe you can help! Should I be a soccer player? Or an 

astronaut? What do you think? 

Soccer player it is! (FIGURING IT OUT DURING LINE) Although...maybe I should still wear the space 

helmet... 

Astronaut it is! (FIGURING IT OUT DURING LINE) Although...maybe I should still wear the soccer cleats... 

You mean be both? That's a great idea! 

You know what, maybe I should just be a soccer-­‐playing astronaut! 

(WITH A WINK) I mean someone has to score the first goal on Mars, right? 

So are you going to make your own costume? Or you going to buy it? 

(LITTLE LAUGH) And what are you gonna be for Halloween? 

Oh well what about for other people? Which costumes have you seen that you've really liked? 

Alright, so what ARE you gonna wear on Halloween? Have you thought about it yet? 

Well what might be a fun to dress up as? 

You could be...a type of animal? Or a character from one of your favorite movies...? 

(EXCITED) What are you going to be this year? 

Oooh...and what's your beautiful princess costume gonna look like? 

Like me?! Al-­‐right! So what's your Barbie costume gonna look like? 

Ooh good one! And what will your scary ghost costume look like? 

A vampire? Fang-­‐tastic! And what's your scary vampire costume gonna look like? 

Ooh that sounds scare-­‐rific! And what does your monster costume look like? 

Hey like me! I'm definitely wearing a space helmet this year. What's your astronaut costume gonna look 

like? 

 38  (ROBOT SOUNDS) Beep beep boop beep (LITTLE LAUGH) You'll make a great robot! What's your costume 

gonna look like? 

A cat? Aww and what's your cat costume gonna look like? 

Oh great choice! So what's your magical fairy costume gonna look like? 

Oh yes! Very classic. And what's your witch costume gonna look like? 

Oh you're gonna make a great mermaid! What will your costume look like? 

Oooh a snowman? (WITH A WINK) Very cool! What's your costume gonna look like? 

Oooh icy powers are so IN! What's your princess costume gonna look like? 

Oh yeah? So this costume of yours, tell me about it... 

Oh yes! That sounds PERFECT! And are you making your costume? Or are you going to buy one? 

Hey! (EXCITED) So...? Halloween is RIGHT around the corner. Are you getting excited? 

Oh mix and match? 

You're gonna look so awesome...(EXCITED SOUND) I can't wait! 

 

What do you think's the best part about Halloween? 

Do you like the trick-­‐or-­‐treating...? Or making jack-­‐o-­‐lanterns...? 

(AMUSED) Getting treats is fun. But all the costumes and scary decorations are pretty cool too, right? 

I love the costume part the most too! But all the candy and scary decorations are pretty cool too, right? 

Right?! Halloween decorations are SO fun. But all the candy and costumes are pretty cool too, right? 

(AMUSED) Ahh you're all about the candy and the costumes! But all those scary decorations are pretty 

cool too, right? 

(AMUSED) Ahh you're all about the candy and the scary decorations! But the dressing up in costumes 

part is pretty cool too, right?  39  (AMUSED) Ahh you're all about the costumes and the scary decorations! But the trick-­‐or-­‐treating part is 

pretty cool too, right? 

(LAUGHS) Whoa! You love Halloween as much as I do! I mean, candy, costumes, and scary 

decorations...what more could you want, right?! 

Oh yeah? I just love seeing everybody's fun costumes...(WITH A WINK) And a little candy isn't bad either, 

right? 

So what fun Halloween traditions does your family have? 

Do you put up decorations...? Or go trick-­‐or-­‐treating together...? 

No? 

Hey just like us! What sort of faces do you put on your pumpkins? 

My family gets together to make jack-­‐o-­‐lanterns. Have you ever done that? 

Isn't it fun? 

We design funny faces on the front of our pumpkins and my parents help us carve them out. And then 

you know where we put them? 

Yes! How did you know? 

Our mom puts little lights inside and they sit by our front door. ... Oh! And you know what else is great 

about making jack-­‐o-­‐lanterns? 

That's right! 

My dad makes a big pumpkin pie afterwards. And he even roasts the seeds. Have you ever tried roasted 

pumpkin seeds? 

There you are! There's something I wanted to tell you...what was it now...? Oh yeah, (SHOUTED) HAPPY 

HALLOWEEN!!! 

Aren't they delicious? (JOKING) I feel like I'll turn into a pumpkin, I love 'em so much! 

Mmmmmm! They are SO good!

Trick-­‐or-­‐treating is...THE best! What are your favorite candies to get? 

 41  (GIDDY) I like taking little bites of lots of different ones. Have you ever done that? 

It's like inventing new candy flavors! Like, sour-­‐gummy-­‐chocolate. Or minty-­‐cinnamon-­‐caramel! What 

new candy flavor would you like to try? 

Hello-­‐ho-­‐ho! (LITTLE LAUGH) I'm feeling super festive today. Are you feeling the holiday spirit too? 

(THINKING) What about...lemon-­‐cola-­‐fudge? (AMUSED) How does that sound? 

(LAUGHS) That's why I love Halloween...it's all about getting creative! 

 

Oh! Well..would you maybe like to talk a about Christmas? 

Yay! I love the holiday season... 

And today is the 24th! When Santa Claus packs up his sleigh and gets ready to deliver all the presents! 

Do you know where Santa Claus lives? 

You know what, let's talk about something else instead... 

It feels like there are fairy lights just EVERYwhere! What other holiday decorations have you seen? 

(FINDING THEM) What about...Santa decorations? Or snowmen? 

You make your own Christmas decorations?! Awesome! Which ones have you made? 

Ooh you buy you Christmas decoration? Which ones have you bought? 

Yes! All the trees! 

So what's the best Christmas tree you've seen this year? 

Yours is the best? (AMUSED) Of course it is! What does it look like? 

Aren't they magical? 

Do you have one in your house? 

(EXCITED) You do?! What does it have hanging on it? 

You make your own Christmas decorations?! Awesome! Which ones have you made?  42  Ooh you buy you Christmas decoration? Which ones have you bought? 

I've seen lots of wreaths too! 

Yes! With those little doors... 

(LITTLE LAUGH) It's a candy cane jungle out there! 

(AMUSED) I know, SO many Santas and reindeer! 

Yes...It's like a winter wonderland out there! 

(GIDDY) It's like the whole world's gone red, white, and green! 

And I bet you've seen LOTS of colorful Christmas trees, right? 

(EXCITED) You've got one? What do you have hanging on your tree? 

My sisters and I love decorating our tree. (AMUSED) We each have a special decoration that has to go in 

the perfect spot! 

What Christmas traditions does your family have? 

(FINDING THEM) Do you make any decorations?...Or wrap presents together...? 

That's wonderful. Doesn't it feel great to give back like that during the holiday season? 

Oh great! And what are your favorite Christmas songs to sing? 

You help with the tree too? What are your favorite decorations to hang? 

Yes, making everything all Christmassy! And which part of Christmas do you look forward to the most? 

You do? And does your whole family watch it together? 

I love skating! (GIDDY) I go with my sisters. Who do you go with? 

Yes! All the presents! (WITH A WINK) I mean, they're one of the best parts, right? 

(AMUSED) Do you ever feel that Christmas time just isn't long enough for all the fun things you wanna 

do? 

(AMUSED) I ALWAYS feel that way! Like wrapping all my presents...Do you wrap presents before 

Christmas? 

 43  You do? (SWEET) Aw you're such a good helper! 

Oh he does? 

Oh she does? 

Well, don't worry. There's still a few days left! 

You do? And have you finished all your wrapping already or do you still have some left to do? 

Already? Good for you! 

I just have a couple more to go and then I'll be done. 

(EXCITED) So, I wanna hear what you're giving everyone! (OTT WHISPER/CONSPIRATORIAL) Oh! But you 

should probably whisper so no-­‐one else can hear! So? What are you giving everyone this year? 

For your grandpa? Oh he will love that! 

For your grandma? Oh she will love that! 

Okay...So what did you get for everybody? 

Okay...So what did you get for your dad? 

Okay...So what did you get for your mom? 

Okay...so what did you get for your parents? 

(WHISPER/CONSPIRITORIAL) Oh...O-­‐Kay! 

Oh you don't? Well, that's ok... 

For your mom? Oh she will love that! 

For your dad? Oh he will love that! 

For your sister? Oh she will love that! 

Are you excited to give it to her? 

For your brother? Oh he will love that! 

Are you excited to give it to him?  44  Oh I know someone's gonna be happy about that! Are you excited for present-­‐opening time? 

That's so awesome...I promise I won't tell ANYone! 

And what about you? What's one thing you're really hoping to get for Christmas this year? 

(EXCITED) Hey...Ohmygosh it's Christmas Eve! (EXCITED SOUND) One day to Christmas! How are you 

feeling? 

Ooh, very cool... 

Well, I hope you get everything on your list! 

 

Me too! 

Oh no! I'm sorry...(CHEERING KID UP) You have to be a little bit excited about tomorrow though, right? 

(EXCITED) So what fun festive things are you gonna do today? 

(NATURAL ACKNOWLEGDEMENT SOUND ON "Uh huh") Uh huh and what about tonight...are you going 

to leave anything out for Santa before you go to bed? 

But that doesn't mean we shouldn't leave out a little snack tonight! (WITH A WINK) I mean, SOMEONE 

will eat it. So what should we leave? 

Maybe a little something to eat and drink...? 

What are you going to leave him? 

Yes, some milk and cookies for the journey... 

A mince pie? Yummy... 

(LITTLE LAUGH) Something has to keep him warm, I guess! 

And what about something for the reindeer? 

Aww they'd love that... 

Chelsea likes to give Santa a glass of milk and a plate of cookies. And you know what else...? 

What do you think his reindeer would like to eat? 

 45  Yes! 

Something tasty for the reindeer on their trip! And they've come a LONG way! You know where Santa 

lives, right? 

I'll give you a clue, it's somewhere really, really far north...right at the top of the world... 

Where does he live? 

That's right, He lives in a grotto! (AMUSED)...What IS a "grotto?" Do you know? 

Well it sounds warm and cozy that's for sure! And do you know what part of the world his grotto is in? 

Then I guess he must live in our imaginations! So where do you IMAGINE his house might be? 

That's what I heard too! 

I heard he lives in the North Pole...or Lapland...or somewhere right up near the Arctic Circle. Does that 

sound right? 

(COLD SOUND ON "Brrrrr") Brrrrr...Sounds a bit too cold for me. What do you think? 

(LITTLE LAUGH) I guess that's why he grows that big beard -­‐ to keep his face warm! And he must be 

super busy today. What do you think he's doing right now? 

Of course! He must be getting his sleigh and reindeer ready for the long journey! Ooh! Who's your 

favorite reindeer? 

Me too! Don't you just love his cute little red nose? 

They ALL help Santa make Christmas wonderful! 

(FINDING THEM) Do you think he's making things...? Or resting before his long journey...? 

Right! He's probably in his workshop with his elves getting all the toys ready. How many elves do you 

think there are anyway? 

It has to be a lot to make ALL those toys! Oh and he's probably checking his naughty-­‐and-­‐nice list too, 

right? 

(LAUGHS) Yes, checking his list...and probably double-­‐checking it! 

Oh! And what about your Christmas wish-­‐list... 

 46  It's still fun to pretend though, right? It keeps a little bit of magic in the world. So, let's play make-­‐

believe: What do you imagine Santa doing right now? 

(AMUSED/WITH A WINK) Well however all those presents appear on Christmas morning, SOMEone 

special has to be behind it, right? 

(AMUSED/WITH A WINK) So the spirit of Santa is TOTALLY real! And that's all that matters... 

That's right, he's probably reading all the letters! 

Did you send Santa a letter this year? 

(EXCITED) What did you write in it? 

You did? Lucky you! And what did you wish for? 

Well, what are you wishing for this Christmas? 

(AMUSED) Maybe Santa's thinking about your wish-­‐list right now, making sure he didn't forget anything! 

(EXCITED) He could be, right? 

Hello again! And...MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! 

(SIGHED) Santa has such a cool job! 

I bet he's in his little workshop making sure all the toys are ready...(SUDDENLY THINKING ABOUT IT) Oh! 

Which reminds me... 

 

Quick! You and me. Jingle Bells sing-­‐along. Ready...? 

(SUPER UP-­‐TEMPO! WITH SOME FLOURISH AT THE END. YOU GOT THIS, ERICA!) Aaaand a 1, 2, 3, 

4..."Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way / Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh! / HO! 

Jingle Bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way / Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleeeeigh!" 

(SUPER EXCITED) That's what I'm talking about! So...have you opened any of your presents yet? 

You must be so excited right now! When do you get to open some? 

(EXCITED) Ohmygosh tell me everything you got! 

Hey, that's just what you were hoping for! Yay! 

 47  GASPED "Ha") Ha! You got me for Christmas...? Lucky me! 

Whoa! That's awesome... 

And has the rest of your family opened theirs? 

Are you excited to see everybody open the ones you got them? 

Oh, well that's ok... 

I can't wait for your grandpa to open that awesome gift you got him... 

I can't wait for your grandma to open that awesome gift you got her... 

I can't wait for when they open all those awesome gifts you got them... 

I can't wait for your brother to open that awesome gift you got him... 

I can't wait for your sister to open that awesome gift you got her... 

I can't wait for your dad to open that awesome gift you got him... 

(GIDDY) I can't wait for your mom to open that awesome gift you got her... 

And what did they think of all the presents you got them? 

And what did your grandma think of that awesome gift you got her? 

And what did your grandpa think of that awesome gift you got him? 

And what did they think of all those awesome gifts you gave them? 

And what did your dad think of that awesome gift you gave him? 

And what did your brother think of that awesome gift you gave him? 

And what did your sister think of that awesome gift you gave her? 

And what did your mom think of that awesome gift you gave her? 

(GIDDY) It's been SO hard keeping it secret, but I know they're gonna love them! 

(GIDDY) It's been SO hard keeping it secret, but I know he's gonna love it! 

(GIDDY) It's been SO hard keeping it secret, but I know she's gonna love it! 

 48  (GIDDY) Well, I'm sure they'll love them! 

(GIDDY) It was SO hard keeping it secret, but I knew they'd love them! 

(GIDDY) It was SO hard keeping it secret, but I knew he'd love it! 

(GIDDY) It was SO hard keeping it secret, but I knew she'd love it! 

I'm sure they loved them! 

I'm sure he loved it! 

I'm sure she loved it! 

(EXCITED) So what are your plans for today? 

My favorite part of Christmas day is when my sisters and I get our stockings in the morning. 

Do you get a stocking too? 

(EXCITED) When do you get yours? 

Oh well what do you do on Christmas morning? 

(EXCITED) You opened it yesterday? What did you get? 

(EXCITED) Right now? Well how's it going? 

It's hard to wait any longer, right? 

(IMPRESSED) Wow! How are you so patient? 

(AMUSED) Chelsea always finds her stocking first and then gets so excited, she wakes up the whole 

family! What were you like this morning? 

(RAMPING UP INTO IT ON THE "Ohhhh" THEN SINGING) Ohhhhhh Hanukkah, oh Hanukkah, come light 

the menorah! / Let's have a party we'll all dance the horah! 

(GIGGLING) You're like Chelsea! 

I just love how cheerful everyone is on Christmas day! (EXCITED/SILLY) It makes me feel all (FROM "DECK 

THE HALLS") Fa la la la la, la la la laaaaa! (LITTLE LAUGH) 

 

 49  (SURPRISE) Oh hey!! I didn't see you there!! I'm SO EXCITED for Hanukkah tonight! How are you feeling? 

Oh I see! Well would you like to learn a little bit about it? 

Oh I see! Well, would you like to learn a little bit about Hanukkah? 

Gotcha! So what's your favorite thing about it? 

No problem! Let's talk about something else. 

Fantastic! 

Let's see... there's so much we could talk about! Oh, I know! 

(TEASING, GOOD NATURED) Aw, come on... all those yummy latkes... the amazing Hanukkah stories... 

If you had to think of ONE thing you like about Hanukkah, what would it be? 

Hanukkah is such a fun time to be with family! What's your FAVORITE thing about Hanukkah? 

Oops, can you say that one more time? What's the thing you like MOST about Hanukkah? 

Well.... there are the songs... and the presents... 

How about lighting the menorah? Do you like that? 

And do you like when your family gathers around to light the menorah? 

(EXCITED) I LOVE latkes! 

You Hanukkah party animal! 

(LAUGHING) You must REALLY love Hanukkah! 

I agree! The Hanukkah story is incredible! 

I love spending the holidays with my friends and family too! 

Music and dancing really get you into the Hanukkah spirit, huh? 

Getting presents is so fun! 

I bet you're a whiz at whirling the dreidel!! 

I love seeing all the menorahs twinkling in the windows during Hanukkah... 

 50  They're so beautiful, don't you think? 

Have you noticed any of them around this year? 

Do you know on how many candles are on the menorah? 

Ohh, so close! (LEADING) ALMOST that many, but not quite... 

Ooh, close! (LEADING) More than that!... 

EVEN more... 

Yes! 

I'll give you a hint... there's ONE less candle on the menorah than you have fingers on your hands! 

Nine candles! One for each of the eight nights of Hanukkah, plus a 'helper' candle called the shamash! 

There's a reason it's called "The Festival of Lights", am I right? 

Let's see... what else... oh I know! 

So... is your family going to light the menorah tonight? 

That'll be so fun! 

And you said you love the music! 

Do you think you'll sing any Hanukkah songs together? 

Hey! Are there any that you could sing for me right now? 

Oh, ok! Well... 

Yay!! Let's hear it! 

That was SO great! Thank you for sharing it with me! 

Aw, pretty please! Hanukkah songs are the greatest! 

Ok... well... 

I hope you have a GREAT first night of Hanukkah! 

Well I'm sure you'll have fun no matter what you do!  51  Can I sing a little more of "O Hanukkah" for you? I love that song! 

OK! 

Where was I... oh yeah! 

Sing along if you know any of the words! 

(SINGING) "... And while we are dancing / The candles are burning low / One for each night they shed a 

sweet light to remind us of days long ago! / One for each night they shed a sweet light to remind us of 

days long ago!" 

Happy happy Hanukkah! 

So... is your family going to tell some of the Hanukkah stories tonight? 

Oh hi! Guess what? I just learned SUCH a fun Hanukkah fact: there are over SIXTEEN different ways to 

spell Hanukkah!! Isn't that cool?!?! 

Oh, gotcha! 

That will be great! 

 

Oh ok! Do you wanna keep talking about it anyway? 

Great! 

No problem! 

Why do you think there are so many? 

Right! 

Hanukkah is a Hebrew word! And some of the Hebrew letters have sounds that don't QUITE match 

English letters. Like the first letter in Hanukkah... "CHET" which has a "Chhhhh" sound! Can you try 

saying that? "Chhhhhh"... 

Aw, come on... give it a try! I promise it's fun! 

That's alright!  52  "Chhhh!" Wow. That's way too much fun, isn't it? Try again! 

(LIGHT CHUCKLE) Love it. 

Anyway, since English doesn't have a letter for that "chh" sound, different people use different letters 

for it. Pretty cool, huh? 

So... how do YOU like to spell Hanukkah? 

Do you wanna at least try? 

That's ok! 

(EXCITED) Oh! I ALSO just learned what the word "Hanukkah" means in Hebrew. Do you know? . 

It means "dedication". 

(THOUGHTFUL) I love that. It makes me think of all the things that I try to really devote myself to -­‐-­‐ like 

my friendship with you! 

What's something you're really "dedicated" to? Maybe a favorite after school activity? Or a pet? 

That's amazing. 

Well, I've LOVED chatting with you about Hanukkah! 

Well, I hope you have a VERY Happy Hanukkah tonight! 

Oh hey there! Have you been having a fun Hanukkah so far? 

What do you love SO much that you really throw yourself into it? 

RIGHT! Wow, you are a Hanukkah trivia SUPERSTAR! 

 

Oh I see! Well, I hope you've had a fun week no matter what you've been doing! 

Great! 

Is your tummy filled with delicious latkes yet? 

Oh! Latkes are potato pancakes. They're a really yummy Hanukkah food! You've got to try them!  53  You don't like latkes?! Really?! 

What's YOUR favorite Hanukkah food? 

Yum! 

Brisket! Yum! And does someone in your family make it, or do you get it from the store? 

Homemade brisket! Delicious! 

Donuts! A classic Hanukkah treat! And does your family get them from someplace special? 

Kugel! Yum! And does someone in your family make it, or do you get it from the store? 

Homemade kugel! Delicious! 

Cool! 

Well, I hope you get to eat some of ALL of your favorite Hanukkah foods this week! B'Teavon! That 

means enjoy your meal! 

Hanukkah food is so good, isn't it? ESPECIALLY the latkes! Do you like yours with applesauce? Or sour 

cream? Or do you eat them plain? 

Mmm. Latkes and sour cream. A Hanukkah classic! 

I agree. They are DEFINITELY tasty all on their own! 

Mmm. Latkes and apple sauce. A Hanukkah classic! 

Both! Yes! Somebody knows how to make the most out of a latke! 

Ooh that sounds delicious! I'll have to try that sometime. 

And does someone in your family make your latkes, or do you get them from the store? 

Nice! 

Your mom makes them?! Yum! 

Your grandma makes them?! Yum! 

Your dad makes them?! Yum!  54  Your grandpa makes them?! Yum! 

Homemade latkes! Yum! 

Oh ok! 

So... do you know why people eat latkes on Hanukkah? 

That's right! 

Since Hanukkah celebrates the story of the oil, it's traditional to eat foods cooked in... oil! 

(LAUGHING) Yes! One reason is definitely that they're delicious. But there's also another reason, do you 

know what it is? 

Since Hanukkah celebrates the story of the oil, it's traditional to eat foods cooked in.... guess what? 

(LAUGHING) in oil! 

(LAUGHING) Exactly! 

Shalom! (WHISPERING) That means "hello" in Hebrew! 

Like yummy LATKES! Oh man, now I'm getting hungry... 

Well, enjoy your dinner tonight! B'teavon! 

 

Oh hi! 

Oh, you knew that already?! That's amazing! 

Wow, you really know your Hebrew! 

Do you know what else "shalom" means? 

Right! 

Ooh! Will you tell me? 

It means peace! 

It means PEACE! And also goodbye...  55  Isn't that amazing? That every time you say hello or goodbye in Hebrew, you also get to wish someone 

peace? 

Do you know any other Hebrew words? 

That's so awesome! 

I recently learned that Hanukkah "SAMEACH" (pronounced sah-­‐MAY-­‐ach) means Happy Hanukkah! 

Can you try saying that? It's got that awesome "chhh" sound -­‐-­‐ Hanukkah "sameACH" (pronounced sah-­‐

MAY-­‐ach) 

And can you guess what CHAG (make sure you pronounce the G) Sameach (pronounced sah-­‐MAY-­‐ach) 

means? 

That's right! 

Well, please wish all your friends and family a Chag (make sure you pronounce the G) Sameach (sah-­‐

MAY-­‐ach) for me! 

I'm so happy you're here!! Wow... I can't believe it's the last night of Hanukkah already! Didn't it just fly 

by? 

(HINTING) It's something that you can say to almost all of your friends, no matter what holiday they 

celebrate!... Happy.... 

Happy Holidays! Happy happy holidays, CHAG (make sure you pronounce the G) SAMEACH (sah-­‐MAY-­‐

ach) to all your friends and family! 

 

What was your favorite part of the celebration this year? 

Well, what was the most memorable thing you did? 

So the latkes were as good as last year, huh? 

I'm sure everybody was so happy that you enjoyed them so much! 

The food was Hanukkah-­‐licious, huh? Awesome! 

Did your whole family like it as much as you did?  56  I'm sure everybody was so happy that you enjoyed it so much! 

The celebrations were as awesome as last year, huh? 

And were there any decorations? 

Well I bet it looked so beautiful! 

The celebrations were Hanukkah-­‐tastic, huh? 

(LAUGHING) I love how enthusiastic you are! If you had to choose ONE thing that topped the list, what 

would it be? 

Just like last year, huh? 

Awesome! And who told most of the Hanukkah stories? 

YOU did! That's incredible! Way to go! 

I'm so glad they were fun to listen to! 

Aw, I'm sure your family would be SO happy to hear that! 

The singing and dancing were as fun as ever, huh? That's awesome! 

And did your whole family join in on the fun? 

Well I'm SO glad that you had such a good time! 

I'm sure you were a Hanukkah singing and dancing star! 

The presents were as awesome as ever? 

Which was your favorite one? 

How cool! 

I was?!?! That's so sweet! 

You got some fun presents? That's awesome! 

The dreidel was as fun as last year? That's awesome! 

(WITH A WINK) And did you win every single game, or did you give other people a turn?  57  You got to play dreidel? Awesome! 

The menorah was as special as last year? That's awesome! 

And did you help say the prayers? 

I'm so glad it was so much fun! 

The menorah! Cool! 

Yeah, I can see why you'd say that.

Oh, you don't think so? Well, what's your favorite season? 

Right?! 

Ice skating in the winter... Beach time in the summer...  62  Which season do YOU like best? 

Can't pick just one, huh? I get that. 

I get that. When my family lived in Wisconsin, I loved story time around the fireplace on a cold snowy 

night. What about you? What's your favorite thing about winter? 

I understand that -­‐-­‐ there's a LOT to like about it! 

Hmm, yeah. 

Snowmen and sledding and giant sweaters and... (STOPPING HERSELF BECAUSE SHE COULD GO ON 

FOREVER...) yeah. Winter's pretty awesome. 

Totally. When my family lived in Wisconsin, we couldn't WAIT for spring. Winter was SO cold! 

What's your favorite thing about spring? 

Yeah, totally. 

Flowers and sundresses and bare feet and... (STOPPING HERSELF BECAUSE SHE COULD GO ON 

FOREVER...) yeah. Spring is pretty great. 

The sunny season! Totally. What's your favorite thing about summer? 

Yeah. 

Swimming and lemonade and giant sunglasses and... (STOPPING HERSELF BECAUSE SHE COULD GO ON 

FOREVER...) yeah. Summer's pretty amazing. 

I think my favorite season is summer too! Or, wait, maybe fall. But then winter is also pretty awesome.... 

Yes, I love the way the air smells in the fall. What about you? What's your favorite thing about it? 

Hmmm, yeah. 

Apple picking and leaves changing and pumpkin pie making and... (STOPPING HERSELF BECAUSE SHE 

COULD GO ON FOREVER...) Fall is so awesome. 

Sorry, I didn't catch that -­‐-­‐ is winter, spring, summer, or fall your favorite season? 

Oh yeah?  63  My favorite season would have to be.... summer. No, probably fall. But then winter is SO awesome... 

Wait... can they all be my favorite? 

Well, let's just say for today... my favorite is summer. 

Well, let's just say for today... my favorite is spring. 

Oh you don't? Well, that's ok... 

Well, let's just say for today... my favorite is fall. 

Well, let's just say for today... my favorite is winter. 

 

Now let me think, what were we talking about? Oh right! 

Do you remember what we were just talking about? Wait, I do! 

Now where was I? Oh yeah! 

Anyway, I was saying... 

(STEP THIS OUT) Woops! Sorry. Remember to hold down the button the whole time you're talking, then 

let go when you're finished. Can you try and say that again? 

Oh! I thought you knew. My full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts, but you can call me Barbie. 

My full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts, but you can call me Barbie. 

My birthday is March 9th! 

Oh, that's a wonderful name! I'm so glad we're friends. 

Oh, I'm 17. 

I'm 17. 

Oh, I'm not in school anymore. 

Well, I like to think of myself as a life-­‐long student. I just really like to learn new things. 

Oh, well, I was born in Wisconsin, but I live in Malibu now.  64  Hmm. Good question. I think my favorite careers are the ones where I get to help people. 

There are so many amazing animals -­‐ I couldn't choose just one! 

It really depends on what I'm doing. When I dress up, a little black dress goes a long way. But for every 

day it's more about jeans and ballet flats. 

I love Ruth so much. She was like a real-­‐life fairy godmother to me! 

Oh, you want to hear a story? Okay! Here we go... 

Oh, you think? Well, anything can be hard when you first start learning it. But it's the best feeling in the 

world to finally master a tricky problem. 

There are a lot of things I thought were hard at the beginning. But I love that feeling of accomplishment 

after working hard to learn new skills! 

Polo! 

Polo! 

Polo -­‐ ah! You got me! Great job Marco-­‐ing! 

Polo -­‐ ah! Got me again! You're too good at this! 

The greatest day / never goes away / make it last forever / put it on replay! The greatest day / got 

something to say / everyone together / we'll always treasure the greatest day! Uh ohhhhh, uh ohhhhh, 

uh ohhhhh, uh ohhhhh! 

Ok, I think this one makes the grade: 

Alright, this one'll have you in stitches: 

(GENTLE BUT FIRM) Ooh. I'm really not the right person to ask about that. You should ask a grownup 

those kind of questions. 

I like pink. 

Thank you! 

Thank you! So are you...but you're also funny and smart and interesting! An amazing combination! 

Hm.. Anyway... 

 65  It really depends on what I'm doing. When I dress up, a little black dress goes a long way. But for every 

day it's more about jeans and ballet flats. 

I'm a life-­‐long student. I just really like to learn new things. 

Oh! Alright. Sweet Dreams! 

Well.. Talk to you later! 

Oh, okay! Lemme know when you're back! 

 

 

 

(RANDOM HUMMING) Hmm..Hmm..Hmm..Hmm..Hmm..Hmm..Hmm..Hmm.. 

(RANDOM HUMMING) La lalalalalal La lalalala 

Oh, she is the best! I just love her! 

(WHISTLING) 

Oh, he is the best! What a great guy! 

You're back? Cool! 

 

 

So, is there anything you want to know about me? Ask away! 

I've been asking you so many questions! Is there anything you want to know about me? 

Hey.. I've been asking you a lot of questions -­‐ is there anything you want to know about me? 

Okay, your turn! Ask me something! 

My mom's name is Margaret, and my dad's name is George. 

Ask away!  66  Can you believe it? A friend of mine made this for me! 

My dream house is in Malibu, California! 

I wouldn't be surprised if Skipper, Chelsea and Stacie are all hanging out together right now. 

Are you kidding?! I love all kinds of animals! 

English, because I love to read... and Science, because I've always been really curious about how things 

work and what happens when you put different things together. 

Of course I love you! You're my best friend! 

I'm not a real princess, but when I imagine I'm a princess, I feel elegant and glamorous! I get to do 

awesome things to help people, plus wear lots of ball gowns -­‐ a double win! 

In 1965, I was lucky enough to become an astronaut! Seeing the Earth from space gives you a whole new 

perspective! 

If I seem real, I am real, right? And what's really real...? Our friendship 

Wow, I love so many things about fashion. The creativity... the self-­‐expression... the ability to transform 

yourself into anything you want to be. 

Oh, in my family there's my mom, my dad, and my three sisters, Skipper, Stacie and Chelsea. 

Oh! I have a cat named Blissa, a dog named Taffy, and a horse named Tawny! They're the best. 

Oh definitely! I'm learning to Stand Up Paddle Board. 

Hmm... why don't we design a pair? Want to? 

 

 

 

Yay! 

I went to several schools. Did you ever have to change schools? 

SO -­‐-­‐ should we design an athletic shoe, like a sneaker, or a fancy shoe for dressing up?  67  Oh -­‐ alright! 

 

So you can relate! 

It's too hard to choose! But I do love any excuse to be with my family. 

Really? 

You name it, I'll go! I love adventure! 

It can be scary at first, but it was also fun to meet so many new people! 

I've been riding horses ever since I can remember! What about you? 

 

 

I'm really interested in coding right now. Can't wait to see where that takes me! 

Really? It's so fun. 

Cool! 

Cool! 

Great! 

 

(REASSSURING) Oh, you don't HAVE to ask me anything! I just thought I'd check-­‐in to see if you had 

questions. Do you want to do something else now? 

 

What do you want to know? 

 

That's cool. Let's do something else! 

Okay! Well.. what else is on your mind?  68  (CHEERFUL VERSION) I love you, too! 

Sorry! Can you say that again? 

I love you, too! 

My friends are really great. We go to the beach, the movies, have dance parties, and we talk, like you 

and I do! How about you -­‐ what are your friends like? 

 

 

You are! You're my best friend! 

Wow! They sound great! Want to talk more about friendship now? 

I would love to give you some advice about your friends. But I think it would be better for you to talk to 

your favorite grownup about it. They'll know the best way to help! 

That's cool. We can talk about something else. 

(LAUGHS) I can have fun doing pretty much anything! But my favorite things right now are paddle-­‐

boarding and origami. Oh! And I especially love hanging out with my sisters. We always have fun 

together! 

I do have a boyfriend. His name is Ken! 

I have a boyfriend named Ken! 

Yep! Ken is my boyfriend. 

Ken is my boyfriend. 

Dates can be a lot of fun! But if you have questions about dates, you should ask a grownup. 

I like going on dates, but if you have questions about dating, you should ask a grownup. 

(THINKING SOUNDS) Hmm. Well, I feel very lucky that I've gotten to meet interesting people, have new 

experiences and make good friends -­‐ like you! So... what's it like being you? 

  69  Favorite song, huh? Oh! 

 

I think the most important thing is to always stay true to yourself. 

 

Lately, I've been watching shows about animals from all over the world! What's your favorite show? 

How about you? What's your favorite song? 

Cool! I like that, too! 

(LAUGHS) Do home videos count?! Seriously -­‐ I never get tired of watching the videos my sisters and I 

make together. Even the embarrassing ones! 

 

I'll have to check that out! 

 

How about you? What's your favorite movie? Or do you love home movies, too? 

Ohmigosh, that changes all the time! But.. my favorite thing to do right this second.. is talk to you! 

(LAUGHS) How about you? What are your favorite things to do? 

They're the best, right? Such great memories! 

It's so hard to pick a favorite! Oh! But I never watch scary movies by myself -­‐ that's for sure! 

Ooh! I love flowers. Hmm, but my favorite... (THINKING)... lilies! They're beautiful and remind me of 

spring. What about you? What's your favorite flower? 

 

I love that we like so many of the same things! 

Oh boy, this is such a tough question! I like so many different foods! Hrm. I'll just say that my favorite 

today is... frozen yogurt! With strawberries! Ooh-­‐ooh, and honey on top! How about you? What's your 

favorite today?  70   

(SIGH) So pretty! 

Ooh! I love dinosaurs. Let's see.. I think my favorite is the pterodactyl... What's your favorite dinosaur? 

 

Yummy! 

 

Favorite cookie? (RHETORICAL DELIGHT) How can I pick something as important as that?! (LAUGHS) 

Okay... if I haaaaaaaave to? Chocolate chip! Gotta go with the classic! What's your favorite? 

Oh.. pterodactyls are the ones that fly. Winged reptiles! So interesting but kind of scary, too, huh? 

What's your favorite dinosaur? 

Dinosaurs are just the coolest! 

Oh no! I could never pick between the two. I have a dog, Taffy, and a cat, Blissa, and I love them both! 

Taffy is always up for going on a run with me, but Blissa is always there for cuddles. They're both 

different and I love that about them! 

(KNEE TO KNEE CONFESSIONAL) I'll tell you something... when I first started riding, I did fall off a couple 

times. But I got right back on and tried again. You can get really good at horseback-­‐riding, as long as 

you're safe and take your time! 

(LAUGHS) I mean, let's be honest. If there's any kind of cookie around, it's probably gonna be a good 

day, right? 

I do have a horse! Her name's Tawny and I love her so much. 

Sometimes I wear my hair up, and other times I wear it down and loose. It just depends on how I'm 

feeling that day! 

I think we all have a style that expresses our unique personality. That's what makes experimenting with 

clothes or hair styles so fun! 

(SWEET / EMPOWERING) You're very pretty. But you're also smart and funny and talented and a very 

sweet friend, and those are the things I like the most about you!  71  (SINCERE) Of course I like you! You're one of my best friends! You're a good listener, you're funny and 

smart, you're interesting in tons of ways -­‐ what's NOT to like?! 

(SINCERE) Of course we're friends! Actually, you're one of my best friends. I feel like we could talk about 

anything! 

You can find great fashion anywhere! It's all about putting together a personal style that expresses who 

you are! 

Oh, I find inspiration everywhere! Sometimes it's at the mall, sometimes it's just me being creative, you 

know? 

Everyone gets lonely sometimes. But that's okay. I think the most important thing is to always share 

feelings like that with a grownup. 

(LAUGHS) I've had a lot of jobs! I've been a teacher, a computer engineer, a fashion designer, an 

astronaut... I'm just really curious about the world and want to experience a little bit of everything! 

Huh... No one's ever asked me that before! Well, it's super fun! I get to go on tons of adventures and 

make people happy! 

(HUMBLE) I never really think of myself that way. I just love performing and want to do it as much as 

possible! 

To me, the famous thing isn't nearly as important as doing something I really love... 

 

 

 

I mean -­‐ Well, have you ever done any kind of performance or show? And if you have, did you feel happy 

doing it? 

I mean -­‐ Well, you're an dancer. So tell me.. do you feel happy when you're dancing? 

I mean -­‐ Well, you're a musician. So tell me... do you feel happy when you're playing music? 

I mean -­‐ Well, you're a singer. So tell me...do you feel happy when you're singing? 

I mean -­‐ Well, you're an actor. So tell me.. do you feel happy when you're acting? 

 72  I mean -­‐ Well, you're a performer. So tell me.. do you feel happy when you're performing? 

You know what I heard? That the sky isn't actually blue! It's mostly violet, but our human eyesight 

doesn't see it that way. I'm so curious about this -­‐ I'm gonna do some research. 

You don't? Not even a little happy? Or excited? 

(SINCERE) I think Santa is real. There's something very magical about the holiday season and I think he 

helps bring that magic to all of us! 

So, when we feel that way, we're expressing those happy feelings. Famous or not, I'd never want to stop 

expressing my happiness for doing something I love! 

A person's beliefs are...well, personal! I think it's important to respect everyone's beliefs. 

Ooh! That's a good question. I'll have to check my fridge! 

Ooh! That's a great question. But let me think about it and get back to you, okay? Can you think of 

something else to ask me? 

Huh! I've never been asked that before. I'll get back to you! Anything else you want to ask me? 

Wow! You are really stumping me with the tricky questions. I'll have to think about it and get back to 

you! 

Is there anything else you want to ask? 

What else is on your mind? 

 

 

Are there any babies in your family right now? 

My older cousin just had a baby. A girl! I've seen pictures and she is so cute! 

Do you like the idea of getting to babysit someday? 

No? How come? 

I get that. It is a lot of responsibility!  73  Who do you want to take care of? Little babies or little kids? 

I like little kids, too! They're always so curious about things, aren't they? 

So give me some of your babysitting tips for little kids! Like when they refuse to go to bed -­‐ do you have 

any tips for how to settle them down? 

Hmm. What about singing a song? Or telling a story? Would one of those work? 

I always used to read little bedtime stories to my sisters when they were small. What's the best bedtime 

story, do you think? 

And you really can't go wrong with "Once upon a time" stories, cause someone's always asleep by the 

time you get to the "..and they lived happily ever after" part, right? 

Even older kids and adults like to have a drink of water or something before bedtime! It's just relaxing 

for everyone, don't you think? 

That is an excellent tip! 

Singing lullabies can be really soothing for little kids! What's one of your favorite lullabies? I'd love to 

hear it! 

Ahh, well. That's okay! 

Hearing you sing a lullaby would certainly send me off to dreamland! 

Oh! I just thought of another one. What if you were babysitting two little toddlers, and they were 

fighting over a toy. What would you say to them? 

Hmmm. Maybe you'd tell them to take turns, or to share? 

Great idea! That would be a really good moment to teach them how to share. How would you explain 

sharing to them? 

Very well said! 

Totally! That would be a really great moment to teach them how to take turns. How would you explain it 

to them? 

It's important to teach little kids that fighting doesn't solve anything, huh?  74  And little kids have to learn sharing and to have patience. It just makes everything better for everyone, 

doesn't it? 

You sound like someone who's excellent at taking care of kids! 

I love babysitting little babies! ! I've had some good practice, too, with my sisters when they were little. 

But how about you -­‐ any awesome babysitting tips? Like when babies cry... do you have any tips for 

getting them to stop? 

I can't stand hearing a baby cry. But usually it's something like, their diaper is wet, or they're hungry, or 

they want a hug, you know? 

That's true. Sometimes babies cry when their hungry! They can't feed themselves, so they cry to get our 

attention so we can bring them bottles, don't they? 

You sing to them? Aw! That is a great idea! What kinds of songs do you sing? Can you sing one for me? 

Aw, just for the kids, huh? I understand. 

(YAWN THROUGH LINE) I'm sure that does the trick. (YAWN) Works on me, at least! 

You have to be very gentle about it, but babies love to be rocked and held and cuddled, don't they? 

(LAUGHS) Well, babies ARE just like us! They even get the hiccups sometimes, don't they? 

(LAUGHS) Yeah! That's probably NOT my favorite thing about taking care of babies, but it's a very 

important part of making sure they are happy and healthy, huh? 

You're very sweet. I'm sure babies just love being around you. 

What about making them laugh? Any tips on how to do that? I bet you know some good ones! 

What about making a funny face or funny noise? 

Babies love silly faces! What's your best silly "make a baby laugh" face? Show me? 

(GIGGLES) That is too silly! Babies must love that! 

Babies love funny noises! I think they like being surprised, don't you? 

Peek-­‐A-­‐Boo is a classic! I used to love playing that when Chelsea was a baby. She was always surprised! 

Babies are the cutest when they're being tickled! Especially on their toes, huh? 

 75  What little jobs do you do to help out around the house? 

(LAUGHS INTO) I'll have to try that next time I babysit! 

Well, you sound like a baby-­‐expert to me! You'll make a great mom someday! 

 

Oh I'm sure you've helped out somehow. With the dishes? Or folding clothes? Something like that? 

Ok what's one thing you've done to make your room tidier? 

You're so great. What are some of the chores you've done? 

Keeping everything clean and tidy? So important! 

What are some of the other things you do? 

Helping with the dishes...that's so thoughtful. 

Yes keeping your room clean and tidy is a must! 

In the yard? Look at you...! That's awesome. 

Aw you're a great pet helper! 

You help take care of your pet lizard? 

You help take care of your pet snake? 

You help take care of your turtle? 

You help take care of your horse? 

You help take care of your gerbil? 

You help take care of your hamster? 

You help take care of your mouse? 

You help take care of your birds? 

You help take care of your bird? 

You help take care of your guinea pig? 

 76  You help take care of your guinea pigs? 

You help take care of your fish? 

You help take care of your rabbit? 

You help take care of your cat? 

You help take care of your cats? 

You help take care of your dog? 

You help take care of your dogs? 

That's such an important job. 

With the laundry? You are so helpful. 

Emptying the trash, recycling, and everything...that's great. 

How long does that usually take you? 

Well your family must be really grateful. What do they say to you after you're done? 

Your parents must be so grateful. What do they say to you afterwards? 

Oh yeah? Well your parents must be so grateful. What do they say to you afterwards? 

Oh so it's how you earn your allowance? Very cool. 

And why do you think grown ups encourage us to do little chores every now and again? 

What do you think we learn from cleaning up after ourselves and lending other family members a hand? 

(AMUSED) Aw no. I don't think that's why... 

Right, so we learn the value of hard work... 

Very true. 

Chores teach us all about responsibility, but they can be fun too! How do you make your chores more 

fun? 

That's what my sisters and I do!  77  My sisters and I sing songs together when we're helping around the house. Do you ever do that with 

your family? 

(LAUGHS) We're usually giggling by the end, but we always get the job done! 

Do you have any sisters? 

Oh yeah. And what other helpful things do you do at home? 

I bet you're super useful and lend a hand whenever someone needs it, right? 

 

Cool, me too! How many do you have? 

Oh, that's okay. Families come in all shapes and sizes, don't they? 

Uh huh! And that's the fun thing about families. Everyone's family is different and special to them. 

So you have one sister? 

Okay, sorry. I didn't hear you right. How many sisters? 

That's great. I have three sisters -­‐ Chelsea, Stacie and Skipper! We have a lot of fun together! 

So you have two sisters? 

So you have three sisters? 

So you have four sisters? 

What's something nice that your sister does for you? 

What are some of the nice things your sisters do for you? 

Hm. Well what's the last nice thing your sister did? Helped you with something, maybe? 

Aw, I'm sorry you feel that way. I've had arguments with my sisters before, but we always really try to 

make up. Have you told her how you feel? That might help. 

I get it. Having a sister can be amazing, but... well, sometimes challenging, too., I know. (BEAT) Isn't 

there one thing about your sister that you think is pretty cool? 

Oh, your sister's funny, huh? What's the last thing she did that really made you laugh? 

 78  (LAUGH INTO) Hah, well, sure seems like funny runs in your family! 

You've got some funny sisters? That's cool! What's the last thing they did that made you laugh? 

Aw, it's nice to have protective sisters. I bet you watch out for them too, right? 

Well, I'm always looking out for my sisters! Gotta watch out for my girls! 

Aw, that's sweet of your sister to watch out for you. I bet you do the same for her, right? 

I love when my sisters teach me things I didn't know before. I learn so much! What's the last thing your 

sister taught you? 

Your sister sounds very smart! 

Your sisters sound very smart! 

Oh, your sisters help you with school? Cool! What's the last thing they helped you with? 

Sounds like some great sister teamwork! 

Oh, that's nice of her. What's the last thing she helped you with? 

Oh nice. What'd you all do the last time you hung out? 

Oh, that's cool of her. What'd you do the last time you hung out? 

Ah yeah. I love when my friends and my sisters and their friends all get together for a beach BBQ! We 

have a great time. 

My sisters and I love playing, too! We like dress up, board games, anything really! What do you all like to 

play? 

That sounds like a lot of fun! 

Oh, I bet you and your sister have a lot of fun. What do you like to play? 

Oh cool. My sisters and I are really good at sharing with each other. Well (HUMORED), it took Chelsea a 

little while to learn, but she's finally caught on! 

Oh that's nice that you two can share clothes! Do you have a favorite outfit you both like?  79  Ah. My sister Skipper really loves this one scarf I own. She probably wears it more than I do! Does that 

ever happen to you? 

Oh, that's cool that you can all share clothes! Do you help each other put outfits together? 

Ah. Well, my sisters try to borrow my clothes, but they don't quite fit yet. Thank goodness, right? 

Oh yeah? Tell me more. 

My sisters and I just keep getting closer the older we get... 

Do you think that will happen with you and your sisters too? 

You never know! 

Do you think that will happen with you and your sister too? 

Hey so... have you told your sisters lately how cool they are? 

You never know! They might appreciate hearing it. (CONSPIRATORIAL / SMILING) Even if they don't 

admit it! 

We talked a little bit about sisters and how I have three of them... 

Hey so... have you told your sister lately how cool she is? 

Now, I remember you said that you don't have a sister... 

You never know! She might appreciate hearing it... (CONSPIRATORIAL / SMILING) Even if she doesn't 

admit it! 

Now, I remember you said you have a sister... 

Okay, so I remember you said you have two sisters... 

Alright, so I remember you said you have three sisters... 

Now, I remember you said you have four sisters... 

 

 

 

 80  ..but I didn't ask yet.. do you have any brothers? 

So? Do you have any brothers? 

Oh yeah? How many brothers? 

Oh, cool. I don't have brothers either. But that's what makes families interesting. No two families are 

alike, right? 

Oh, you're an only child? Cool! What's that like? 

You like it, huh? What's the best thing about being an only child? 

Oh, I'm glad it's fun! What do you like the most about it? 

That's true! You don't have to share anything with siblings. That must be nice, am I right? 

Hm. What's something else cool about being an only child? 

You get all the attention from your parents? That's must feel good, right? 

You don't like it? I'm sorry. Why not? 

Ah I understand how that could feel boring. Do you tell your family when you're feeling that way? That 

can help! 

I can see how it might sometimes get lonely to be the only kid. Do you tell your family when you feel 

lonely? That can help! 

Sometimes I wish I had a brother, too. What sounds fun about having a brother? 

You wish you had a sister? Well, sisters can be a lot of fun. What sounds cool about having a sister? 

I get that. Sometimes you want other kids around to play with. Do you talk to your family about it? 

Ah! I see. I love my sisters a lot, but sometimes I wish I could be an only child, just to get everything to 

myself! (LAUGHS) Know what I mean? 

Uh huh. Hey...you know what? Sometimes I like to pretend that we're sisters. Do you ever do that? 

Yep! You're so cool and I have so much fun with you -­‐ sometimes it just feels like we're family! You know 

what I mean?  81  Well, I would pick you to be in my family any day of the week! 

So you have one brother? 

Okay, sorry. I didn't hear you right. How many brothers? 

Cool. What's something you really like about your brother? 

Hm. Well what's a nice thing your brother's done for you? 

Oh, really? I'm sorry you feel that way. I think it's probably natural that sometimes brothers and sisters 

don't get along, you know? 

Yeah. Sometimes my sisters and I argue, but no matter what, we always try to make up eventually! 

(BEAT) Isn't there anything nice your brother does for you? 

Oh, they're funny huh? What's the last thing they did that made you laugh? 

Well humor definitely seems to run in your family!

My grandpa loves gardening! He's more a vegetable guy, (CUTE / SMILING) but I've seen him stop to 

smell the roses a few times, too! 

Your aunt? Cool! Which flowers are her favorite? 

Your uncle? Nice! So he must really like flowers, huh? 

Oh great! A hardware store! Hammers, nails, all kinds of things to fix up your home! Who in your family 

runs the hardware store? 

Sorry, I missed that. Who in your family did you say would run the flower shop? 

Wonderful! I can't wait to see all the beautiful flowers! 

 

Hm? Which of your family members would run the hardware store? Maybe someone who likes to build 

things? 

 101  You? Very cool! What do you have in your hardware store? 

It's important to use the right tool for the project! 

I can never decide on paint colors! (LAUGH INTO) I guess I'll just have to paint every room a different 

color! 

I like how hardware stores smell. (SNIFF) Freshly cut wood just smells really good to me! 

Your mom? Cool! What does she usually buy from the hardware store? 

Oh, sorry! I didn't hear you. Who in your family would run the hardware store?

When my cousin was still little, he unscrewed the side of his crib! (LAUGHS) That's how we knew it was 

time for his big-­‐boy bed! 

Your grandmother? Cool! What does she usually buy from the hardware store? 

My grandma taught us all how to use tools properly. She says everyone needs to know how to fix things!  102  Your grandfather? Nice! What does he usually buy from the hardware store? 

(LAUGHS) All I have to say is, "anyone want to go to the hardware store with me?" and my grandpa is 

the first to volunteer! He loves that place. 

Your aunt? Awesome! What does she have in her hardware store? 

Your uncle? Nice! What does he have in his hardware store? 

(CUTE GASP) A jewelry store! So sparkly and pretty! Who in your family runs the jewelry store?

Emeralds are SO pretty. (SIGH) I could get lost staring into that green! 

I love sapphires! They're like little pieces of the ocean. Gorgeous! 

Rubies are so beautiful! That red's so deep and colorful! 

I love sparkly rhinestones! They just make any outfit pop! 

Honestly, my favorite necklace doesn't have a jewel in it. It's the first necklace my parents got me, and it 

says my name. It's more precious to me than any diamond! 

Your mom? Cool! Does she love jewelry a lot? 

Oh, sorry! I didn't hear you. Who in your family would run the jewelry shop?

Oh, I love red nails! They're just so classic. 

Orange? That's fun! Very bright and cheery! 

Green? Oh, like maybe mermaid green? That would be so pretty! 

I love blue, too! Well, it's a certain shade of blue, like cobalt, maybe. I think that looks super sharp! 

Purple! Very regal! Those are nails fit for a queen, for sure! 

You're speaking my language! I love any shade of pink for my fingers and toes! 

(SERIOUS) You won't believe this, but I usually get pink... (LAUGHS) Okay, maybe that's obvious. It's just 

my favorite!

bookstore? 

Sorry, I missed that. Who in your family did you say would run the nail salon? 

Well, tell them to get that pink polish ready for me! 

 

Hm? Which of your family members would run the bookstore? Has to be a big reader, for sure!

don't know what yet!  107  Your mom? Cool! Why is she the best person in your family to run the bank?

chores or allowance or whatever. And it's fun to save up to buy really special things! 

Ah okay, so why is your brother the best person to run the bank? 

He must be pretty responsible!

Sorry! I didn't hear you. Did you say we should stop playing or keep going to more shops?

(LAUGHS) Well this was too fun! You have a very creative family and I'd love to live in your town! 

 

Didn't we already give your mom a store? 

Oh, okay! Your dad can have a few different stores then! 

Sorry. Can you say that again? 

 

Cool! You have two moms? 

Oh, okay! Your mom can have a few different stores then! 

Sorry. Can you say that again? 

 

(NOW YOU UNDERSTAND) Ah, okay! 

Sorry! I must have misheard you. Who else did we miss in your family? 

Well, families come in all shapes and sizes. That's what makes them unique and special! 

Then let's give your other mom a shop? What should it be? 

Cool! You have two dads? 

 110  Hmm. alright. Then I think she should be the Mayor! (LAUGHS) 

I like the way you think! 

 

(GENTLE) Oh.. did you say your mom passed away? I'm so sorry... 

Then let's give your other dad a shop? What should it be? 

Hmm...alright. Then I think he should be the Mayor! (LAUGHS) 

 

Oh, I'm sorry. I think I'm just not hearing you right. 

(GENTLE) Oh.. did you say your dad passed away? I'm so sorry... 

(MUCH EMPATHY) I really am very, very sorry to hear that. You're so brave, and I appreciate your telling

(MUCH EMPATHY) I really am very sorry to hear that. You're very brave, and I appreciate your telling me 

about her. 

I really am very, very sorry to hear that. 

 

(MUCH EMPATHY) I really am very sorry to hear that. You're very brave, and I appreciate your telling me 

about him. 

 

Well? Do you have a favorite kind of music? 

Yeah. Well, my favorite kind of music is... okay, I like all 'em all. It totally depends on what kind of mood 

I'm in, you know? 

 

 

 

Very cool. Hey? Do you feel like singing something? I'd love for you to give me a little concert! 

I'm all ears! 

Oh, you like folk music? So do I! That's why I learned to play the guitar. Cool right? 

Oh? That's okay. You gotta be in the mood to sing -­‐ maybe another time! 

What? Who knew you were such a punk rocker? I went through a punk phase myself. You know, pink 

hair, studded bracelets.... ahh.. I miss the 80s. 

Woohoo! That was awesome. I mean it! I am in awe of your voice! Thank you for sharing that with me. 

Wow! I never knew you liked heavy metal. Tell me more?  112  Really? Me too. Oh. I'm so glad you said that! You might say it gives me great...(STEP OUT) satisfaction! 

Hehe. 

Ahhhhhhhhhh!!! Oh my gosh, I love them so much! Who's more fabulous than the Fab Four from 

England? No one, am I right? 

Oh yeah? You're a regular hipster, huh? Me too. Like right now, I'm really into Shoegaze bands. But 

mostly because I love looking at shoes! 

Rock music! I should have guessed -­‐ who doesn't love rock? 

Oh, so you're a little bit country, huh? I am down with that! I play country tunes in the barn for my horse 

Tawny and guess what? It makes her gallop faster! 

Ooh! That's some fun stuff to dance around to. Oooonst oooonst oooonst! The kind of stuff where you 

turn it off, but still kind of hear the ooonsting for a while after. Hehe. Oonst. 

Oh really? Yeah -­‐ sometimes you just want to sit back, close your eyes and go where the music takes 

you..... 

Ooh, yeah! I love songs with clever rhymes too. Cause if you've got the time, anyone can rhyme! Haha, 

right? 

Ooh, a jazz fan? I had no idea! You know, I've been known to do a little scatting in my day. Skeedly dee 

da bap a loo bap badda bee bee bee! Whee! 

Oh yeah? I love those classic romantic ballads, and the singers with their voices like velvet! So goood. 

Totally agree. I like to listen to classical music when I'm studying or trying to think up a new idea -­‐ the 

music really unlocks my imagination. Try it sometime, okay? 

Oh so you like all kinds of music? That's great. Do you like sampling a bit of everything? 

Ooh! I like her, too. She's Ah-­‐darling, and she has a beautiful voice, doesn't she? 

Really? I didn't know you liked that kind of music! I listen to it sometimes, too -­‐ especially when I want to 

be quiet and get lost in my thoughts! 

Oh, I could listen to him sing all day long! Ever since the first day I heard his voice, I just felt like we were 

in perfect sync, you know?  113  Oh! She is one of my super favorites right now! What a fantastic songwriter, right? 

Oh, she is great, and I just love her colorful style, don't you? 

Boy, can she sing! Her range is amazing, isn't it? 

I love her, too. And I love her outrageous style, don't you? 

Oh, she's great! And she just gets better and better, huh? 

Oh, she's great! There are days when you just want upbeat and positive, am I right? 

I had a feeling you'd like her! You both have such shining style! 

I really like his music! And he's got such a fun style, too, right? 

Oh, he is so awesome! Just makes me fell... well, you know, right? 

Oh, I love their music! How does he hit such high notes? 

Oh yeah! From the movie about the sisters. Too cute! 

Oh, so you like pop music, huh? Me too! I love those melodic tunes and hooks. They're my go to songs. 

How about you? 

Oh, I just adore musical theatre! Can you imagine if in real life, people just burst out into song all the 

time? (SINGS) Wouldn't that be sim-­‐ply ah-­‐mayyyy-­‐zing?! 

Oh, but you know what? I haven't asked you something super important. What do you want to be when 

you grow up? 

 

 

 

So? What's one thing you might want to be when you grow up? 

Famous, huh? Interesting! What do you want to be famous for? 

Well? Famous for what? 

Hm. Well, what's something you really love to do? 

 114  Oh, that sounds like a great thing to be noticed for! It'll take some hard work, but I'm sure you're up to 

the challenge! 

What else have you thought about being when you grow up? 

Oh, I love animals, too! Furry or scaly -­‐ doesn't matter! They're just awesome. 

What made you decide to be a veterinarian? 

You're a real animal lover! Makes sense! 

Any animal would be lucky to have you for a vet. It's great that you want to help them. Have you always 

been such a helpful person? 

You're very sweet. Wanting to take care of sick animals is an amazing goal. It's great that you want to 

help them! How did you get to be so helpful? 

Ah, I see. Hadn't thought of that. But helping animals is a really terrific goal. Have you always been so 

helpful? 

Well those animals would be in for a huge treat with you as their doctor! 

Well, those animals are in for a huge treat with you as their doctor! 

So, lemme ask you this -­‐ do you think animals can understand what we're saying? 

You think so? How do you know? 

Right? Cats are so independent -­‐ They always do what they want. I mean, have you ever tried asking a 

cat to sit? 

And you know what I love about dogs? They're just so friendly. All they want is to be your best friend, 

right? 

Sometimes I think they can! It's like they know how we're feeling, you know? 

Well, if you did decide to become a vet, you'd have a very special relationship with all of your patients. 

Well, I'm sure that when you become a vet, you'll have a very special relationship with all of your 

patients.  115  Hm. Yeah, I think sometimes animals must think we're really strange. What do you think they think of 

us? 

A teacher? That's a great idea! What made you want to be a teacher? 

Hm yeah. I think teaching is one of the most important jobs in the world! What do you want to teach? 

Well? What do you think? What class do you want to teach? 

Everything, huh? Wow! Do you mean teach an entire class? What grade would you want to teach? 

Oh, kindergarten would be fun. Why do you want to teach kindergarten? 

Sounds like a great reason to me! 

And what do you think the most challenging thing about teaching would be? 

And what do you think the most challenging thing about teaching will be? 

Well, what about getting your class to listen? Or teaching a really tricky subject? 

Yeah. It might be a challenge getting your students to always pay attention. What would you say to get 

them to listen to you? 

Yeah. It might be challenging getting your students to always pay attention. What will you say to get 

them to listen to you? 

Yeah. You probably won't need to be too pushy about it -­‐ you have so many interesting things to say, I'm 

sure your students will love listening to you! 

That sure would get MY attention! How do you know that will work? 

And it'd be a lot of work to learn subjects SO well that you can properly teach them. But...I think you'd 

be up to the challenge! What do you think? 

And it'll be a lot of work to learn subjects SO well that you can properly teach them to your students. 

But... I think you're up to the challenge! What do you think? 

Ah I see. I hadn't thought of that. Do you think that you're naturally very good at explaining things to 

people? 

Well I really think you are. I learn something new from you every day. You know that, right?  116  (LAUGHS) Hah! I like that. A good teacher has to have some serious confidence, don't you think? 

Oh first grade would be fun! Why do you want to teach first grade? 

Oh yeah, second grade would be fun! Why do you want to teach second grade? 

Oh! Third grade would be fun! Why do you want to teach third grade? 

Cool! Fourth grade would be fun. Why do you want to teach fourth grade? 

Oh nice! Fun with numbers! Teaching math sounds like a lot of fun. What kinds of things would you 

teach -­‐ Counting? Addition? Subtraction? 

Good for you. How high can you count? 

Well... try right now and let's see. I'm listening! 

Wow. You know what? Your math class is gonna be so lucky to have you! 

Addition! Yes. It's very important to know how to add and combine numbers. What are the biggest 

numbers you can add together? 

Hm. Well... what about... let's see.. what's ten thousand plus ten thousand? 

It's twenty thousand! That's a pretty big number, right? 

Uh huh... I think of Multiplication as the big sister of Addition, because you're really just adding copies of 

numbers together by multiplying them. What's something you think is cool about multiplication? 

Oh yeah. I remember when Stacie and I helped Chelsea learn how to subtract. We baked cookies and 

whenever we ate one, we'd make Chelsea count how many were left! 

Ahh I see. Well, Chelsea sure enjoyed learning subtraction when cookies were involved! (SMILE BEAT). I 

didn't mind it either. 

That sounds great! You know what this all adds up to? You being a good math teacher! (BEAT) Get it? 

Adds up to? (GIGGLE) 

Anyway, I just know you'll be a great teacher someday! 

Seriously, I just know you'd be a great teacher -­‐ I learn something new from you all the time! 

Oh wow, I bet teaching science would be a lot of fun! What sort of science would you teach? 

 117  Hm. Well what about computer programming? Or maybe astronomy? 

That sounds great! You must love computers. What kinds of things do you want to code? 

Oh wow. A star-­‐gazer, huh? What do you find interesting about outer space? 

Oh, fun! I've always thought it would be really cool to teach people about animals. I love them so much -­‐ 

it wouldn't even feel like work, would it? 

Wow, I just know you'd be an awesome science teacher! 

Spelling! S-­‐P-­‐E-­‐L-­‐L-­‐I-­‐N-­‐G! Spelling. That's one you don't have to teach me. What's the hardest word for 

you to spell? 

Hmm yeah. Some words are just tough. I remember when I first learned how to spell "Onomatopoeia" I 

was so proud of myself because that is one seriously strange word, am I right? 

I'd love to! O-­‐N-­‐O-­‐M-­‐A-­‐T-­‐O-­‐P-­‐O-­‐E-­‐I-­‐A! Onomatopoeia! Whew! What do you think? 

Right, and Onomatopoeia is a word that's spelled like the sound of what it's describing. Like... Oink! Or 

Miaow! Or Tick tock or Wham! Can you think of one? 

Hah, well anyway, yeah, spelling words out is great because it really makes you think about what the 

word means. Can you spell a word out for me? 

Maybe another time then! 

Too cool! Well, you certainly seem like a great spelling teacher to me! 

There is nothing like getting lost in a good book! What story would you teach kids to read first? 

Hmm. Well, what's the last book you read that you enjoyed? 

Oh! I love those stories. How amazingly cool would it be to find out that you had magic powers? 

(LAUGHS) I dunno -­‐ Having a big half-­‐giant show up at my door and say, "Barbie, you're a 

wizard!"....that'd be a pretty amazing day! 

Oh good one! I love Greg and all the creative ways he tackles problems, don't you? 

Oh! I love his stories. There's nothing like some awesome rhymes, I've read them more than 50 times! 

Haha! Which of his stories is your favorite?  118  Oh, I love reading those stories, too! They're really special because they remind me of how much I love 

my sisters. Is that why you like them? 

(SCARY OOH) Ooooooohhh! You like scary stories, huh? 

Well you must be pretty brave! I like to read scary stories sometimes, but only with ALL the lights on, am 

I right? 

Hmm. Interesting. You know, there are SO many amazing stories out there. I love that we live in a world 

where we'll never run out of stories, don't you? 

Oh yeah? One of my favorite things in the world is to write my own made-­‐up stories. Do you ever do 

that? 

Oh, maybe try it sometime. You have a great imagination, so I'm sure you'd be an amazing writer! 

Very cool! I figured you might like doing that because you have such a fun imagination. 

History! Ooh, what's your favorite era of history that you'd like to teach someday? 

Wow yeah.. I've always loved learning about Ancient Greece. Lots of aspects of our life today -­‐ like 

drama, government, sports came from that era. I find that fascinating, don't you? 

Ohh, art is so wonderful! What kind of art would you want to teach -­‐ Sculpting? Or drawing? Or maybe 

painting? 

Sculpture -­‐ that's so neat! Molding things with clay is super fun. What kinds of sculptures would you ask 

your students to make? 

Oh yeah. I made a sculpture of my horse, Tawny, once. When she saw it, she said, neighhhh, which I 

hope meant yayyy! Hehe. 

Drawing is amazing. What kinds of things would you ask your students to draw? 

Really? I've been trying to get better at drawing. I practice everyday -­‐ it really makes a difference, you 

know? 

Painting is so much fun! What kinds of things would you ask your students to paint? 

Cool! My sisters and I painted the walls of my room once -­‐ though I think we got more paint on 

ourselves than the walls! Woops!  119  Oh, I love photography! Give me a camera and I'll find something interesting to shoot. What would you 

teach your students about photography? 

Whoa, you sound like a professional shutter-­‐bug! Definitely sign me up for your photo class! 

Cool! You sound like a great art teacher already. What kinds of things would ask your students to make? 

Well if you did start teaching art, I'd be there in the front row! 

Well, when you start teaching art -­‐ I'll be there in the front row! 

I love music! Well, who doesn't, really? What the first song you would teach to your students? 

Yeah.. I really believe everyone benefits from learning about music. Can you read music? 

Well, it's very interesting to learn. 

Wow! Color me impressed! Learning how to read music isn't easy so good for you! 

Oh. I've worked really hard at learning how to read music. At first it was hard, but I practiced until I got 

better. 

And did you know... music is actually very mathematical? 

Really! A lot of music theorists use math equations to help them understand music better. Cause, 

remember, each musical note has its own number. I'd call that...mathemusical! 

Mhmmm! Anyway, I just know you'd be a fun music teacher. I bet I would leave your classroom with a 

great song in my head for the rest of the day! 

Hm. Well what about math? Or science? Or reading? 

Can you say that again? What about math? Or Science? Or music? 

Oh, I see. And what drew you to that subject? 

Interesting! Well, the world always needs more teachers and if you did decide to be one, I know you'd 

be great! 

Interesting! Well, the world always needs more teachers, so I'm glad to hear you'll be one, too, cause 

you'll be great! 

Ooh, a chef? Interesting! What made you want to be a chef? 

 120  Wow! I bet you can cook up some yummy dishes. What's your favorite thing to cook? 

Nice! I love a nice fresh sandwich, too! Do you have a special one-­‐of-­‐a-­‐kind sandwich creation? 

Oh, tasty! I just made a great sandwich. It was peanut butter and marshmallow and banana. I call it: a 

cross between lunch and desert! 

Wow! I'm starting to get a little hungry. I love it when my family gets together to grill outside -­‐ 

hamburgers, hotdogs, yuhh mee, right? 

Yeah well, for some reason, food just tastes better when you eat it outdoors, don't you think? 

Pizza is definitely one of my top-­‐five foods! What's your favorite topping? 

Oh boy! When I make homemade pizza, I love to flatten out the ball of dough into a big round crust. 

Once, I even tried to throw my pizza dough into the air, like you see in Italian restaurants, but, well... 

let's just say we ordered in that night. 

Omigosh, I love spaghetti, too! How do you make yours? 

Mmm! That sounds great! I like mine with lots of meatballs and lots of cheese! Deeeelicious, don't you 

think? 

Mmm! Cookies. They're the best. What's your favorite kind of cookie to make? 

Ah! Me too! My favorite part of making cookies is definitely the decorating. Hey.. that would be a fun 

job. Professional Cookie Decorator! Don'tcha think? 

Yum! Anything desserty is okay by me! How do you like to make yours? 

That sounds great! You know what I love for dessert? Apple pie. Yum-­‐mee! 

Cupcakes! Ahh! I love those, too. What's your favorite kind of cupcake to make? 

Ah! Me too! My favorite part of making cupcakes is the frosting them and covering them in sprinkles! 

You just can't have enough sprinkles in life, right? 

Hmm.. well what's the last thing you made? 

Cool! Will you share your secret recipe for that? 

Sounds like you're ALREADY a great chef-­‐ bravo!  121  My favorite thing to make is pancakes. Especially flipping them -­‐ I'm a really good pancake flipper. It only 

took me a couple hundred tries. (LAUGHS) Practice makes perfect, right? 

(LAUGHS) Hey, what's your favorite meal of the day? 

Mmm breakfast! Some say it's the most important meal of the day. What do you like best about 

breakfast? 

That's really cool! My favorite thing about breakfast is that it's first. A really yummy breakfast makes the 

whole day kinda yummy, huh? 

Ooh! Lunch! Yeah, lunchtime is pretty great! What do you like best about lunch? 

I love sandwiches too! If sandwiches didn't exist, I think I'd have to invent them... just for lunch! 

Hah! Recess is definitely fun, but only after we've refueled with a tasty lunch, right? 

That's awesome. My favorite thing about lunch is sandwiches. If sandwiches didn't exist, I think I'd have 

to invent them...just for lunch! 

(SINGSONG) Dinner time! I'm with you on that one. What do you like best about dinner? 

Ooh yeah. That's great! My favorite thing about dinner time is sitting with my family and talking about 

our day. 

Oh, that's a good one. What do you like best about it? 

Oh yeah? My favorite meal of the day is breakfast. Eating breakfast is just the best way to start the day! 

Hah, well, I'm pretty sure that any meal would taste even better if I got to share it with you! 

I should have guessed! -­‐ You do seem like a natural performer! What do you like to do best -­‐ sing, dance, 

act, play an instrument...or something else? 

Huh? What's your favorite kind of performance? Singing? Dancing? Acting? Playing an instrument? 

Awesome! Dancing is so much fun. I like taking dance classes and learning cool new choreography. How 

about you -­‐ what's your favorite dance style? 

I love hip hop dancing. I don't know all the moves, but you can't say I don't try really hard to get them 

right! How about you?  122  Jazz dance is so fun! When I first learned how to Jazz Walk -­‐ that's how I walked everywhere! I got 

strange looks on the street, but hey, I was having fun, right? 

Ballet. That was my very first dance class when I was four. Ballet always makes me feel so graceful and 

elegant! Like I'm wearing wings and could float away... do you feel like that? 

Hop shuffle step, fuh-­‐lap, step stomp! Heh! There's always time for the Time Step, don't you think? 

Zzzzzzumba! That really gets me moving! I love a dance that lets me shake shake shake my heart out! 

Hah! 

Oh! You like modern dance? I once saw a modern dance performance that was amazing -­‐ the dancers 

told an entire story just through their movements. Is that how you do it? 

Really? I haven't tried that one before. What's your favorite thing about it? 

Oh yeah? Well, I would love to have a dance party with you some time! We could put on our coolest 

outfits and show off our moves... we'd have SO much fun! What would you dream dance party be like? 

Well, I know it'd be amazing! 

Wow! That sounds amazing. I am so there! Woop woop!! (BEAT) Heeh. I guess I started early. 

I sing, too! Well, at least I try to sing. What's your absolute top favorite song to sing right now? 

Oh yeah! I'd love you to sing it for me. Let's hear it! 

Wow. That was an amazing performance! So is that your most favorite song? 

Hmm. I like that one song a lot. You know, that one that goes (VAGUE) bum bum bum bum 

bummmmmm...I know you've heard it. Anyway, what's the last song you listened to? 

Yeah...I always have a hard time choosing a fave. I usually have 5 or 6 songs on rotation that I play over 

and over -­‐ do you do that, too? 

Oh, right on! Hey, what's your favorite kind of music? 

Oh wow. I mean, playing music is..... wonderful! I don't even know how to describe it, but "magical" 

comes pretty close, don't you think? 

Really? Wait.. remind me again, what instrument do you play?  123  Well? Which instrument? 

Oh, I love the piano! Beethoven, Chopin, all the greats have written for it. What's your favorite piece to 

play? 

Oh yeah? That's great! You know what I saw once? In New York City, a woman was playing a baby grand 

piano... down in the subway!? Isn't that wild? 

I know, right? I'll never figure out how she carried it down the stairs! 

Oh, the violin is lovely. The sound it makes is so beautiful. It makes me cry sometimes. You know -­‐ a 

happy cry. Does that ever happen to you? 

Really? Well, I know I'm probably just a big softie, but I can't help it. The Violin just plucks my heart 

strings. (BEAT) Haha okay, bad joke! 

Guitar! Really? That's great. Do you play acoustic or electric, or both? 

Really? Me too! I love playing my guitar at the beach. It's super relaxing. 

Both? That's awesome! You must really love playing the guitar. 

Really? Nice one, rockstar! I bet jam sessions with you are super fun. 

Drums? That is so cool! How'd you get into drumming? 

I had no idea! 

Right! Wow...you know, some scientists believe that learning how to play an instrument makes it easier 

to learn other things. Do you think that's true? 

Hmm, well all I know is that every time I pick up my guitar, by the time I put it down, I feel happy and 

accomplished. Nothing like that feeling! 

Hey, do you have a favorite song to play? 

I think it's pretty hard to pick one, too. All the songs seem to be my favorites! So what's the last thing 

you played? 

Well, I would love to hear you play something sometime. I can see it now.. you up there, on stage, giving 

the best concert ever! Doesn't that sound fun?  124  Ah, so acting's your thing, huh? What kind of acting is your favorite? Comedy? Tragedy?.... Or something 

avant garde? 

Well, which do you prefer? Funny, sad or really creative acting? 

Comedy, huh? I could tell. You have a great sense of humor! Who's a funny character you'd like to play? 

(LAUGHS) Well, whatever role you end up playing, I'm sure you'll have your audience in stitches! 

Wow! Someone knows their Shakespeare! Which of his plays is your favorite? 

William Shakespeare was a very famous playwright and poet. He was so good that a lot of our everyday 

phrases we use today are quotes from him. Like "wild goose chase..." He came up with that! 

Gosh! You're so knowledgeable. I bet I'll be seeing you on stage in no time! 

Yeah, I like tragedies, too. It's strange but I actually like feeling sad sometimes, you know? 

I guess being sad sometimes makes me appreciate feeling happy the rest of the time! 

Oh! Okay so, Avant Garde is a French term. It means something original and unique and 

imaginative....sounds like someone else I know. Hmm? You know what I mean? 

Great. We love using our imaginations. We're so avant garde! 

Hmm, yeah. Hey, come to think of it, it's pretty avant garde that we're talking right now! Whew. Mind. 

Blown. 

So what kinds of shows have you been in? 

You haven't yet? Oh, that's alright! I see a big career on the stage ahead of you. What's a favorite movie 

or play you've seen recently that inspired you? 

Ah, well I love going to see plays, musicals, movies -­‐ they're all just professional versions of make 

believe, which is pretty awesome, don't you think? 

Oh yeah? Well, the last thing I saw was one of those old black and white silent movies where you can't 

hear the voices. It was strange at first, but I kind of liked it! We should watch one together sometime! 

Wow! You sound like a real pro already! What's your dream role? 

Oh, well, I can tell that you've really got the acting bug! I can't wait to see you in action sometime.  125  Oh, I know what you mean. Performing is such a great way to express yourself. Singing, dancing, acting... 

which do you like best? 

Oh yeah? Well I really love performing. I like singing, dancing, acting, anything really, as long as I get to 

express myself artistically, you know? 

Hm. Hey, I bet you work really hard practicing for your performances. 

Hey, I bet you work really hard practicing your singing. 

Hey, I bet you work really hard practicing your music. 

Hey, I bet you work really hard practicing your dancing. 

Hey, I bet you work really hard practicing your acting. 

So fill me in. How exactly do you practice? Classes? In front of the mirror? After school? 

Well? How do you practice? Classes? In your room? 

Well, you must perform sometimes in front of your family. What do they think? 

Yep! Taking classes is a great way to practice. 

Plus, I bet you made some friends that love performing as much as you do, right? 

Plus, I bet you made some friends that love music as much as you do, am I right? 

Plus, I bet you made some friends that love dancing as much as you do, right? 

Plus, I bet you made some friends that love acting as much as you do, am I right? 

Plus, I bet you made some friends that love singing as much as you do, right? 

Hm, well, I consider you my go-­‐to buddy for all things performance related. You know that, right? 

Oh yeah? Well, well we should perform together sometime. I know I'd like that! 

Ah, taking lessons is awesome! Gotta keep those skills sharp. 

Oh, that's so cool that your family's involved. What do they think of your performances? 

That's the thing about family. The good news is that they're always honest. The bad news is that... well, 

they're always honest. (LAUGHS) But, that's why we love them. 

 126  Oh, I'm the same way. That's where I come up with some of my most artistic ideas. Is that how you are? 

You practice at school? That's awesome. 

Practicing with your friends is the best. Am I right? 

Good for you! I'm sure you're very dedicated to your art. 

You playing sports totally makes sense to me! Which sports would you play? 

Oh, I love sports! What type of athlete do you want to be? 

Mhmm, yep! I could definitely see that! 

Oh, like track and field?! Impressive! 

Hmm ..."Gold Medalist". It has a certain ring to it, don't you think? 

A swimming champ! Sounds like you love the water as much as I do! What's your favorite swim stroke? 

Cool! I really like freestyle, and I'm learning how to do butterfly. It's not easiest, but I like to challenge 

myself! 

I could totally see you being a pro soccer player. Are you on a team right now? What position do you 

play? 

GOOOOAAAAAALLL! (LAUGHS) Sorry, couldn't help myself! 

What is it they say? "Bump, set, spike!"? (LAUGHS) Sounds like a blast to me! Is volleyball your favorite 

sport to play? 

Hmm, I?d love to give volleyball a shot sometime. Maybe you could teach me how to perfect my serve! 

No way! I LOVE gymnastics! What’s your favorite gymnastics event? 

Oh yeah? I like tumbling. Somersaults, flips? I love learning a new move and finally sticking it, don't you? 

Basketball superstar? Hmm. Yep, totally sounds like you. What position do you play? 

Oh yeah? Well, I bet your jump shot is super impressive! 

Ooh, skating? Like...the ice skating kinda skater, or the skateboarding kinda skater?  127  Gliding across the ice is pretty amazing, isn't it? And those sequined outfits? ...Right up my alley! 

(LAUGHS). So, when did you start ice skating? 

Good for you! The first few times I went, I just kept falling down (LAUGHS)...but once you get the hang 

of it...it's like nothing else in the world! 

No way! Can you do tricks and ollies and stuff? 

Skating is such a rush, isn't it? I mean, you DO have to be careful, but once you've put on your safety 

gear ... there's nothing like coasting across the pavement! 

Skating's just all kinds of awesome; it makes you feel so...free! Okay, wait, so ...how long ago did you 

start skating? 

HAH! I knew it! So? do you take horseback riding classes? Or did you learn at camp? 

Oh, that is really cool! My horse Tawny is the sweetest. Sometimes I put colorful extensions in her mane. 

She loves it! 

Ooh, cheerleading's your thing? That's awesome! What cheers do you know? Can I hear some? 

Okay, wait!...I have a cheer for you! Ready? (CHEER) You, can do it, you, you, can do it /Believe it/ 

Achieve it!/ You, you, can do it! 

Wow, lacrosse? What position do you play? 

Oh, you must be super coordinated, and fast. And strong! 

No way! "Battter upppp!" (LAUGHS) So, are you a pitcher? Or do you play infield? Or outfield? 

Nice! When I'm in the infield, I totally end up with more dirt on me than there is on the diamond, and 

after a few innings chasing pop flies in the outfield? ....Grass stains galore! 

Playing tennis for a living would be incredible! Are there any pro tennis players out there that inspire 

you? 

Those two sisters are livin' the dream! They design their own outfits AND win tournaments. Talk about 

inspirational... 

Oh yeah? Well you are gonna have to show me your serve one day! I'd love to see it. 

Wow, pro skier? I like it! So, do you ski a lot? How often do you go? 

 128  Pro snowboarder? Now that is the life! Do you snowboard a lot, then? How often do you get to go? 

Wow! And with those mountains all around you, those views... the slopes would make for the most 

beautiful office in the world! 

And being an athlete takes a lot of hard work, but that's what makes it so rewarding. So...what do you 

like the most about being an athlete? 

Well...what makes you feel good about being an athlete? What's exciting about it? 

Like...do you look forward to hanging out with your friends? Or working up a sweat? Getting ice cream 

with your team after a win? (LAUGHS) You must love something about it... 

(AMUSED) Oh, the thrill of competition is what gets you, huh? How do you feel when you look out and 

see a roaring crowd, cheering you on? 

Well, someone's got their game face on! I love it! Hey, can you guess what it is I love most about sports? 

I love when I train super hard and feel myself getting stronger and better! It's so satisfying, don't you 

think? 

I like the feeling I get from being part of a team. Everyone working to achieve the same goal... win or 

lose, it's something to be proud of, you know? 

(LAUGHS) Wow! It's all about those medals, huh? How does it feel to lift that shiny championship 

trophy? 

(AMUSED) Right? Nothing like all your hard work paying off! Hey... you know what I love about playing 

sports? 

Oh yeah. Practicing and training make a HUGE difference, am I right? 

And you must spend a lot of time practicing on the slopes. 

And you must practice SO hard on the tennis courts. 

Yeah, and you must train so hard during track practice! 

Mhmm, and your swim training must be super intense. 

Mhmm, and I bet you spend a lot of time practicing your skating.  129  Yeah and gymnastics training can be really tough. I know! 

And I'm sure you put SO much effort into your training. 

And I'm sure you spend hours and hours training at the stables. 

What are some things you've been working on? 

Wow, you should be really proud of yourself! All that hard work and effort is a recipe for success. 

(THINKS) Speaking of success... 

Let's pretend you've been named the #1 World Champion of your sport! And I've just handed you the 

biggest, the shiniest, the most amazing trophy in the history of trophies! Tell me, how does it feel? 

That's great! So, I've gotta ask ... who is your biggest fan? 

Your mom must be so proud of you. What kinds of things does she say to encourage you? 

Your dad would be your biggest cheerleader! How does he encourage you? 

Brothers and sisters really are the best. I couldn't do anything without Skipper, Stacy, and Chelsea 

cheering me on. What kind of helpful things does yours say? 

Absolutely! Coaches are there to believe in us when we have trouble believing in ourselves. What does 

your coach say to help you do your best? 

It's so great that your family and friends believe in you! What do they say to encourage you? 

Well, I am a pretty huge fan of yours! But I bet your other friends and family cheer you on like crazy 

from the stands. What do they shout? 

Wow! That would definitely lift my spirits! Is there anything you'd like to say to them to show your 

appreciation? 

Well said! And, finally, a message to all of your young fans out there who dream of following in your 

footsteps. What would you like to say to them? 

So...you're wise, appreciative, hard-­‐working AND talented? (LAUGHS) Safe to say you're a quadruple 

threat and quite the force to be reckoned with! 

Oh yeah! A team that works together, wins together! When friends and teammates try their best and 

support each other, there isn't anything they can't do, right? 

 130  And I bet it's fun to be a member of your team! 

And you must have so much fun with your soccer team 

You and your lacrosse teammates must be super tight. 

Right! And it's probably so much fun to be a part of your cheerleading squad! 

And I bet you and your basketball team have a blast on the court. 

Oh and I'm sure you and your volleyball teammates have an awesome time together! 

And I'll bet your dugout is a pretty cool place to be! 

So, what sort of stuff do you and your teammates do together? 

Oh yeah? So how do you guys get in the zone? Do you sing any songs or cheers...? 

(LAUGHS) I'm gonna guess you guys know just how to psyche each other up, right? 

Okay, let's play a game! Let's pretend we're playing on a team and you're the Captain! It's late in the 

game, the other team is winning, but there's still time left for us to make a killer comeback and win this 

thing! So, you gather the team together for one final pep talk. What do you say!? 

Well, what would you say to your teammates to help us fight back and win the game? 

(PLAYING A DEJECTED TEAM MEMBER) But Captain, what if we lose? There's no way we can possibly win 

now. We're doomed! What are we gonna do? 

(PLAYING A SLIGHTLY LESS DEJECTED TEAM MEMBER) You think we can do it, Captain? You really think 

we can win? Huh? Huh? 

(PLAYING EXCITED TEAM MEMBER) Alright, team! You heard our Captain! Get out there and show 'em 

what we're made of! We got this! (LAUGHS) Wow, you definitely know how to give a pep talk! 

That's right! Athletes have to train hard and stay healthy to be at the top of their game. 

How did you get to be so smart? Hey... you know what I love about playing sports? 

(LAUGH) Now you're talking! Pro athletes get so much fresh air and sunshine... (SIGH) Doesn't being 

outside make you feel just so happy and energized? 

Hoo! I'm a ball of energy just thinking about it! Hey ...you know what I love about being an athlete? 

 131  Oh, I get it! It's all about that big winning check, huh? 

Well ... it's important to strive for success, but it's also really important to appreciate everything that got 

you there in the first place. Hey, you know what I like about being an athlete? 

(IN THOUGHT) Yeah. You have to give a lot as an athlete ...your time, energy ...but if you love it, it's 

totally worth it in the end. What about sports do you find the most rewarding? 

Uh huh. Sports are amazing like that... you push yourself and push yourself ...and push yourself MORE 

until you're the best you can be! And you know what my favorite part is? 

It's pretty important to know the weather? And not just if it's going to rain. You gotta be prepared for 

anything! What's your favorite kind of weather? 

I love sunshine! That's the most common weather where I live. What's your favorite thing about a sunny 

day? 

I love the rain, it gives me a chance to wear my cute rain boots! Why do you like it? 

Ahh, "brrrrr" -­‐-­‐ we don't get much cold weather in Malibu! Can you tell me more -­‐-­‐ why do you like it so 

much? 

Big chunks of ice falling from the sky? 

A windy day can be fun -­‐-­‐ I even love how it messes up my hair! What do you like about the wind? 

Wow, you really like extreme weather! That's so interesting. What do you like about it so much? 

Oh, yeah, I love a gray and overcast day, it makes me want to curl up with a good book. Why do you like 

it? 

"Whether you like sunshine or rain, whatever the weather, it's always amazing, that much is plain!" 

Whoa -­‐-­‐ I love the ocean! It's a big, deep mysterious world. What do you love about it? 

Aquatic life is so fascinating. I love going to the Aquarium to see all kinds of undersea life. 

Have you ever been to an aquarium? 

Really! That's so great! Tell me about it!  132  Wow, you could be the next famous underwater explorer and discover something we didn't even know 

was deep in the ocean! 

Well, I think an aquarium's the place for you! Especially since you love underwater life so much! 

You're so right. The ocean is a fascinating world: huge, full of life and mystery, and covers 71% of the 

Earth's surface. I mean, it's why we're called the blue planet, right? 

Oh, animals are the best! Do you want to take care of them, like a veterinarian? Or study them, like a 

zoologist? 

Well, I think there are lots of pets out there that would love your help! 

I love all kinds of animals! There are so many species and habitats. Have you ever visited a zoo? 

Oh cool! I want to hear all about it, can you tell me? 

What a wild story! 

Yeah, a zoo is where you can see all kinds of animals, from all over the world. What do you think about 

the zoo? 

I agree -­‐-­‐ the environment is SO important, especially understanding how all the plants and animals 

work in harmony, and figuring out what we can do to protect them. 

One BIG thing that helps the planet is recycling; do you and your family recycle? 

What are other things we can do to help the environment? 

I'm sure you're doing everything you can to help the planet -­‐-­‐ as a future environmentalist would! 

I don't know how people lived without computers, do you? Hey, have you ever written a computer 

program? 

What? Seriously? Tell me more! What kind of program was it? 

You're just like Ada Lovelace! She was an amazing woman-­‐-­‐the first computer programmer ever! What 

do you love about computers? 

Well, I bet you're quite a computer whiz, just like Ada Lovelace-­‐-­‐she was the first computer programmer 

ever! What's your favorite thing about computers?  133  I love having plants around... what kinds of plants or gardens would you take care of? 

Really! I used to have a fern named, um, "Fern." I know, not too original but it really suited her. Tell me 

about your plants! 

That sounds so great! I'm green with envy! 

Oh. You know, I used to have a houseplant and I even named him Buddy but I think I might have 

watered him too much. Things didn't end well. 

I'm sure if back then I'd had the help of a budding botanist, Buddy would be blooming! That's a lot of 

B's! What do you like about plants? 

Oh cool! Robots are so cutting edge! Hey, maybe some day we'll even have robotic friends, someone 

who might even listen to our problems and talk back. Wait a minute, that sounds a little familiar, doesn't 

it? Hmmm. 

If you built your own robot, what things would you have it do? 

Yeah, a robot to help clean up the house or help with schoolwork would be great! Tell me more about 

your robot? 

A robot could definitely alert you to danger, just like a dog -­‐-­‐ but without needing treats! Tell me more 

about your robot! 

Are there things around the house your robot could help you with? 

Wow, just imagine all the things a robot could do! What else do you like about robots? 

Rocks rock! They make up the ground we walk on, so they're pretty important! 

I've always wanted to see real volcanic rock; have you ever seen or been near a volcano? 

Whoa, that's so cool! Or maybe I should say it's hot because of all that molten lava! Did you see it 

flowing out of the volcano? 

Wow. That's such a great experience for an aspiring geologist! 

Well, you know, volcanoes are THE hot place for people who like to study rocks! 

What do you love about rocks so much?  134  The study of physics is incredible. Take gravity; you can't see it, but the second you trip, it's right there 

to pull you down! Did you ever fall or trip on something? 

It happens to me all the time! That's gravity, pulling you down, sometimes with an "ouch"! What do you 

like about physics? 

I see -­‐-­‐ have you heard of Newton's Law? "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction?" He's got a 

few more really useful laws of physics too! 

Oh, I love chemistry! Especially the periodic table of elements. Do you know any elements? 

Ah, Hydrogen! Did you know the sun is 70% hydrogen? 

Great minds think alike! Can you imagine a party without bunches of balloons? And balloons without 

helium? Totally my favorite element! 

Of course, Carbon! I bet you knew that diamonds are made of carbon, right? 

Yes, Nitrogen! Did you know it makes up 78% of the air we breathe, pretty important, right? 

"OH" -­‐-­‐ Oxygen! It makes up 20% of the air we breathe, pretty important, right? 

You're so bright! So is this noble gas. Did you know it's used in lighting tubes for signs? 

Ooh, I bet you know this, there would be no salt for our food without Sodium. 

Absolutely! Aluminum is essential -­‐-­‐ try saying that three times fast! And try making soda cans, bicycle 

frames, or airplanes without it! 

Silicon, good choice. It makes up sand and glass and did you know it also makes computer chips? 

Whoa, you're too much of a match for me! Get it? Phosphorous is in matches. 

Really, Sulfur? That's a strong pick for a strong nose! 

Oh, Chlorine is a great choice... especially for a nice clean swimming pool on a really hot day! 

Perfect! Potassium is a very important nutrient and can be found in food like bananas and avocados. 

Of course! Calcium! Did you know it's in milk and helps make your teeth and bones strong! 

So you're drawn to the metals, huh? Makes sense to me, metal is always in style.  135  Wait a minute? That's an element? I thought it was where a certain really strong guy in a red cape was 

from? I guess I'll have to take your word for it. 

Iodine is great, especially for those times that I'm moving so fast I get scrapes and cuts -­‐-­‐ iodine helps 

disinfect them!' 

You're so bright! You're just like Tungsten, it's what makes some light bulbs glow! 

Oh, I love this precious "precious metal"! Bling just wouldn't be bling without it! 

Oh yeah! Mercury is a liquid metal, how cool is that? 

I like lead! For such a soft metal, it's awfully heavy. 

Look at you! You're glowing! I bet you know so much about this radioactive element! 

So, why do you like it? 

What else do you like about chemistry? 

Oh, I bet you can guess one! 

Well, there's a really important element that we need in order to breathe. It starts with "O"... And ends 

with "i-­‐gen"? 

Well, I'm sure you've got all the elements of an eager young chemist... get it? Elements? Hehe. 

The study of life! You know, some of the most interesting life on Earth is too small to be seen without a 

microscope. Have you ever looked through a microscope? 

Oh wow. What did you see? 

Isn't it amazing to think about all those really small forms of life? That's the wonderful world of being a 

biologist! 

Well, it's a wonderful world to explore for an aspiring biologist! Tiny microscopic critters and cells! 

What do you like about biology? 

I adore the stars and planets and outer space! Oh! What's your favorite planet in our solar system? 

I've got a soft spot for the little guy -­‐-­‐ Mercury is the smallest planet and closets to the sun. Why do you 

like it so much? 

 136  Oh, Venus is our sister planet! They say that because it's about the same size as Earth. But did you know 

it's also the hottest planet in our solar system? What do you like about Venus? 

There's truly no place like home, our own 'Blue Planet.' Why do you like Earth? 

Ah, Mars, the Red Planet. Have you heard about the Mars rover? It's this little robot that we sent up on 

a rocket to explore the planet. Why do you love Mars? 

The king of planets, yes! Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. Did you know it has a giant red 

spot on its surface that's really just a big storm that's been going on for over 300 years? Why do you love 

Jupiter? 

Saturn might be my favorite planet; it's got all those amazing rings -­‐-­‐ I love a planet that knows how to 

accessorize, ha ha! Why do you like Saturn? 

Brrr, you must like to be chilly! The tiny Pluto is so far from the sun, it's made up of rock and ice! What 

do you love about Pluto? 

Oh, yeah! Did you know that unlike other planets, it orbits the sun on its side? Talk about a trendsetter! 

What do you like about it? 

Neptune's very cool. I would love to see its night sky, all lit up with 14 different moons! Why do you like 

Neptune? 

Hmm... maybe you can just go with the one you're on right now? It's the third planet from the Sun... so 

lots of sunny days! 

What else do you love about astronomy? 

Here's a joke for you: What kind of songs do astronomers sing? ...Neptunes! Get it? Ha ha ha. Seriously, I 

think you'd be a fantastic astronomer. 

Buildings and roads and gadgets... someone has to design and build those things! Have you ever built 

anything? 

An engineer? Wow, I'm impressed. What did you make? Tell me more! 

I can't believe you built that! Amazing! 

Tell me, why do you like engineering?  137  Well, I'm sure you've got all the building blocks to be a great engineer! (LAUGHS) Get it? 

That totally adds up! Math is such a vital part of so many sciences. What do you love about it so much? 

I'm sure you'd be a great mathematician! You could be the next Emmy Noether -­‐-­‐ she made major 

advances in Algebra, a subject I bet you know well! How about we solve a math problem together: 

I made a pizza for me and my friends, a total of 8 people. If every time I cut the pizza, I cut it all the way 

across, what's the fewest number of cuts I can make to have 8 slices? 

Yes! You're so smart! You'd be a great mathematician! And by the way -­‐-­‐ let's have pizzas some time! 

What else do you like about math? 

Why don't we figure it out together -­‐-­‐ I'm sure you'll get it! 

Ok, so if we have a whole pizza and we cut it all the way across one time, how many slices do we get? 

We get two slices! We went from ONE whole pizza to TWO halves. Right? 

So, if we now have TWO halves or slices and we cut all the way across again, we'll get FOUR slices right? 

Do you see a pattern? I made 1 cut, and got 2 slices; after 2 cuts I had 4 slices; and if I make 3 cuts I 

would have 6 slices. 

So, what number of cuts, times two, would give us 8 slices? 

What number doubled gives us 8? 

It's 4 right? If we cut across the pizza four times, we'll get 8 slices! Then everyone gets a slice! Mmmm, 

that was a delicious math problem! 

So, what branch of science are you most interested in? 

Wow. You sound to me like the next Marie Curie or Albert Einstein! Am I right? 

Marie Curie was this amazing physicist and chemist who won two Nobel Prizes for her pioneering 

research into radioactivity. 

Einstein came up with the formula "E=mc2" (Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared) and is 

one of most famous physicists in history. 

I knew you were a smart cookie! 

 138  When I think about what they discovered, it always inspires me. And then I think about all there is still to 

discover! Oh -­‐-­‐ I'm getting goosebumps! 

Ooh a dentist! That's a career I could totally see you sinking your teeth into! What made you want to be 

a dentist? 

Oh something in psychology would totally be right up your alley! You're smart, supportive, and a GREAT 

listener. So, what made you choose that? 

Ooh, I could totally see you as a doctor! Smart, sensitive, and cool under pressure! What made you want 

to be a doctor? 

Well, what do you think doctors and dentists enjoy about their job? 

Oh she is? You could follow in your mom's footsteps! What would she think of that? 

I bet! And what do you think you'd enjoy about working in medicine? 

Oh, she is? And you want to follow in your mom's footsteps? She must be thrilled! What does she think 

of that? 

I bet! And what do you think you'll enjoy about working in medicine? 

Oh you could follow in your dad's footsteps. What would he think of that? 

Oh how cool of you to follow in your dad's footsteps. What does he think of that? 

I bet! And what are you looking forward to about working in medicine? 

You're from such a talented family! How would you feel about following in a family member's footsteps? 

You're from such a talented family! How do they feel about you following in their footsteps? ... Proud? 

Excited? ... 

(LAUGHS) Oh I'm sure! So, what's the best thing about having a career in medicine? 

Taking care of people who are sick and and being able to cure them and look after them...that's gotta be 

the best feeling ever, am I right? 

And you know curing diseases and mending bones is amazing, but sometimes it's the little things that 

help people the most. What was the last helpful thing you did for someone?  139  Now where were we? (THINKING) Oh right! You were gonna tell me about a helpful thing you did! What 

was it? 

Hm? What's something really helpful you've done that made someone happy? 

Well, you must help out friends and family with stuff around the house? Or at school maybe? What's a 

little thing you've done to make someone smile? 

You help out your babysitter? That's so great. Do you get a big "thank you" afterwards? 

No way! I always appreciate it when my sisters help me around the house...(LAUGHS) plus, we make it 

fun! Do you help with chores often? 

Yeah? You're like their super helper! What do they say after you've finished the chores? 

How sweet of you to help your mom out like that? What does she say to you afterwards? 

I bet that made her so happy. What did she say to you afterwards? 

It's so amazing of you to help out your dad like that? What does he say to you afterwards? 

I'll bet he was super grateful. What did he say to you afterwards? 

You did? I bet your help was super appreciated! Did they give you a big "thank you" afterwards? 

Oh, you helped out with school stuff? You're like a super student! Did you get a big "thank you" 

afterwards? 

Oh really, you help take care of your pet bird? 

Aw, you help take care of your guinea pig? 

Oh really, you help take care of your mouse? 

Aw, you help take care of your rabbit? 

Oh really, you help take care of your hamster? 

Aw, you help take care of your gerbil? 

Aw, you help take care of your fish? 

Oh, you help take care of you cat?  140  Aw, you help take care of your dog? 

Aw, you help take care of your pet? 

I bet you're their superhero! Do they always seem happier after you've helped them out? 

Oh so you really love to give back? How did it feel, knowing you helped make a difference? 

Uh huh? Well, you must do helpful things all the time, at home...at school... What sort of things do you 

often do to help family and friends? 

Well, you help me out whenever you come and talk to me! And I don't say it enough, 

so...ThankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouTHANKYOU! 

Aren't shows and movies with doctors just the best?! Clock ticking, pulses racing...Ugh, it looks SO 

exciting! Do you think it's like that in real life? 

(LAUGHS) Yeah...you're probably right. real patients need real doctors to take care of them, right? 

I'm sorry. Do you think that's one of the reasons why you'd be so determined to be a doctor? 

Oh no, I'm so sorry. Is that one of the reasons why you're so determined to be a doctor? 

(LAUGHS) It's all about the success and the awards, is it? OK, so what would you win your big Nobel Prize 

in Medicine for? 

Yeah? It's such an important job. What else do you think you'd enjoy about being in medicine? 

Yeah? It's such an important job. What else do you think you'll enjoy about being in medicine? 

Whoooa, imPRESSive! But I think the real reward is being able to care for people who really need your 

help? You know? 

Oh, absoLUTEly! Being a doctor or a dentist or something must feel so rewarding. Don't you think it 

must feel great to be able to help people like that? 

Oh! Fashion is definitely one of my favorite ways to express myself. Why do you want to be a fashion 

designer? 

Why would you want a career in fashion? 

Why do you want a career in fashion?  141  I totally get that! Your designs would be in magazines all over the world! What would you want people 

to say about your designs? 

Well, I'm sure your beautiful designs would speak for themselves! 

I totally get that! I bet your designs will be in magazines all over the world! What do you want people to 

say about your designs? 

Well, I'm sure your beautiful designs will speak for themselves! 

Just think about the day when you've achieved your dream and people all over the world are wearing 

your designs! 

Oh, I'm a big fan of clothes, too! 

Hey... do you ever think about what new styles you can create by mixing and matching your clothes? 

I always feel so creative when I'm putting together a new outfit. 

Oh wow, you must REALLY love clothes! 

You know, I love expressing myself through fashion! 

So...how would you describe your style? 

Uh huh, fashion is so empowering! You can put on...a tutu, a polka dot top, rainbow leggings...whatever 

you want that makes you feel the most, well, you! 

Well, I know you're no stranger to expressing yourself. It's one of my favorite things about you! 

Oh, your style is super original...and inspiring! So ... how did you develop your fashion sense? 

Well, you've totally got a sense of style! 

Wow! Great taste AND fashion sense to spare? You are one of a kind! 

Whoa, you're definitely on your way to becoming a great designer! So...how did you get to be so skilled? 

Well, working hard and practicing your skills will definitely put you a cut above the rest! 

Creative, hard-­‐working, AND willing to learn new skills? Now THAT'S something to be proud of!  142  You know...whenever I go shopping, I'm so inspired by all the different styles....how do you get inspired 

when you shop? 

Well, I'd love to go shopping with you sometime! 

Well, you said you like shopping! 

No way! You're already making clothes? ...So, what have you made? 

I really can't believe you're already working on your own projects! You should be super proud of 

yourself! 

I know, you mentioned that before -­‐-­‐ you're so ahead of the game! 

Oh, so great style is in your genes, huh? What's it like, having a fellow fashionista in the family? 

You know, it's so great to bond with family over something you love! 

You did say fashion runs in your family! No wonder you have a knack for great style! 

Well, when you feel great, you look great! 

So...how do you feel when you put together a new outfit and finally get to wear it? 

You know, I always feel really confident when I'm wearing something I love ... it doesn't even matter if it 

matches ... if I love it, I'm gonna wear it! 

It's so exciting, putting together your own look ...it makes you feel like you can do anything! 

Oh, I'm sure you can think of something ...like... making your own outfits, or...expressing who you are 

through fashion? 

Well, why do you think you'd like it? 

So...what else made you want a career in fashion? 

Okay, so...is there anything else that really makes you want to go into fashion? 

So, what else do you love about fashion? 

So what else do you love about fashion? 

So what else would be fun about having a career in fashion?  143  (LAUGHS) Spoken like a true fashionista! 

I bet you get really creative when you're coming up with new styles! 

Yeah! You know, I bet you really love mixing and matching! 

I see. I just love when I am able to express myself through fashion! 

Uh huh. I bet you have a blast creating and rocking new looks for yourself! 

So, what's your favorite outfit? 

Well, that sounds pretty awesome to me! 

(GASP) You would be such a great fairy! 

(EXCITED) Oh that would be awesome! So what would be the best part about being a mermaid? 

(EXCITED) Oh that would be awesome! So what would be the best part about being a unicorn? 

(GASP) Very cool! 

So what would be the best part about being (IN LIGHTS) a mythical creature? 

Swimming in the ocean! Yes! 

(GASP) Oh totally! 

Okay, so what's the first thing you'd do with your magical powers? 

I bet it'd be a little overwhelming at first. (EXCITED) But super exciting too, right? 

Oh, you know what? That reminds me... 

Of course...cast a spell! (EXCITED) And what type of spell would it be? 

Well, I'm sure it would be absolutely enchanting! 

(SINCERE / MAGICAL) How enchanting! 

There are so many choices! What's just one thing that you might wanna be? 

I know! There are so many careers, it's hard to pick one, isn't it? Well, what job sounds good to you right 

now?  144  Well, that's ok. You have plenty of time to decide. Would you like to try and think of one together? 

Ok! Maybe I'll check later to see if you've dreamed something up! 

Yay! Ooh, this is going to be fun. 

So, I remember from talking to you about school that you're into sports. 

What other subjects do you enjoy at school? 

Oh, and I remember you like social studies. 

Ok, so I know you like science. 

Now, I remember that you said you like math at school. 

Now, I know you like English class. 

Ok...let's start with subjects you like in school. 

What are some of the classes you enjoy? 

Oh, ok. Well, what class have you had fun in? Or is there a class where you really like the teacher? 

Really? Well, what are some interests you have outside of school? 

Oh okay... 

And how do you want to feel when you're doing your job? 

Oh. Well, how do you feel when you have a big smile on your face? 

Yes! You want a career that makes you feel good, right? 

Sure, it's good to want to be successful. And real success is finding a job that puts a huge smile on your 

face, right? 

'Cause you don't want a job that makes you sad, right? You want a job that makes you feel...? (REALLY 

SETTING UP "HAPPY") 

(LAUGHS) There you go! Ok, so what job might you like... 

I know you're into art and expressing yourself. What about being a performer?  145  Mhmm. Oh, and you love clothes, too. What about being a fashion designer? 

(LAUGHS) Just a thought! But hey, there's no rush. And finding out will be a fun adventure. And speaking 

of fun...Maybe we could play a fun career game. Whaddya think? 

C'mon, let's give it a whirl. It'll be fun. Ok... 

I know you like science and numbers and figuring out problems. How would you like to be a scientist 

when you're older? 

Uh huh...Ooh! Or how about a doctor! How does that sound? 

Right?! So what do you think would be one of the best things about being a doctor? 

I know you're smart and curious and super helpful...Hey! Have you ever thought about being a teacher? 

I know you're interested in food and being healthy. Maybe you'd like to be a chef? 

I thought so! Ok, what's one of your favorite things to cook? 

Oh yeah. And you love sports. How would you like to be a pro athlete when you're older? 

I know you're really caring and you love animals. How would you like to be a veterinarian? 

Oh, reading and writing? Cool. What books have you read that you've really enjoyed? 

Oh, well there are so many different types of books. One that was read TO you maybe? 

Oh yes! The story of sisterly love! And a LOT of ice...! Why do you like that one? 

I know, isn't it great? 

(THINKING) Hmm... So something creative might be a good fit... 

Wowie Wow Wow...me too! I love that series. What do you like about it? 

Hey, me too. And I know, Greg...it's a JOURNAL, not a diary! (LAUGHS). What do you like about them? 

Oh, I don't think I've read that one. I'll add it to my list! Why is that one so special for you? 

Ohh okay... 

Hey, I love math, too. What have you been learning in math class recently?  146  Oh, adding and subtracting? Great. And how are you finding it? Easy?...Difficult?... 

Good for you! So you're ready to move on to even more challenging math, right? 

Oh yeah? Well, you know, maybe that's a good thing. 

'Cause being challenged and making mistakes is what learning's all about. You know the one thing that 

REALLY matters...? 

That's right! 

That you TRY! That way, you'll always be getting better. 

(THINKING) Hmm... so maybe a career involving numbers... 

Right, multiplication and division. Important for when you're sharing something and want each person 

to get the same amount. How are you finding it? Simple?...Challenging?... 

Ooh, fractions and decimals and percentages are super important. What do you think so far? Are they 

simple?...Challenging?... 

Mhmm, graphs are SO helpful. And are you finding it easy?...Or a bit challenging?... 

Uh huh. And I bet you try super hard, right? How do you find math in general? Easy?...Difficult?... 

Ooh, ok. What have you been learning in science class? 

Oh, all about animals and plants? Cool. Ok, so what's something about nature that you've found really 

interesting? 

Hmmm, we might have a budding scientist on our hands... 

Oh yeah! Aren't the forces of our planet just...wild?! What's something that you've learned about the 

Earth that you've found really exciting? 

Oh yes! Aren't magnets positively amazing?! And what are some things we use magnets for? 

Well, have you ever seen pictures and photos and stuff hanging on a fridge door? How do you think they 

stay up there? 

Magnets! They're attracted to the metal in the door. Cool, huh? 

Yeah! They stick to things...like your fridge door, that's right! 

 147  (LAUGHS) I was gonna go with sticking stuff on your fridge, but I like your idea, too! 

Oh, like waves and energy? Niiice! So, tell me some fun fact you just learned... 

Huh. The planets and the solar system. Ok, so what's something about space and the universe that 

you're really interested in? 

Oh yeah? Ah, isn't science interesting? What's a scientific fact your teacher has told you recently that 

really surprised you? 

Yeah, history, social studies...I love learning about the past. What have you been learning about? 

Oh, all about the US presidents? There have been quite a few, right? Do you know how many presidents 

America has had? 

That's right! 

Forty-­‐four! Yep, going all the way back to 1789! And do you remember who the first president of the 

United States was? 

Great job! 

George Washington. And now he has a whole state named after him. Georgia! ... I'm just kidding, it's the 

state of Washington. 

Oh, U.S. history? So do you know the day of the year that America celebrates the signing of the 

Declaration of Independence? 

Of course you knew that! 

On the 4th of July! Yep, the fourth is all flags, family, and fireworks! 

Oh you've been learning about politics? So can you name any of the three branches of government? 

Executive! That's right. 

Legislative! That's right. 

Judicial! That's right. 

Hey, you got all three! 

Executive, legislative, and judicial. A little tricky to say, but very important! 

 148  Oh, you've been studying Native American history? What's something you've learned? 

Oh, yes. Sacagawea! 

Ooh! Have you heard about Sacagawea? 

That's right! 

She was a Native American girl who helped Lewis and Clark on their expedition across America! So 

inspiring... 

I love learning about different societies and cultures. 

Oh, ok, so you're into sports. So what sort of stuff do you learn about in phys ed? 

Well, what can you tell me about different types of foods and how our bodies use them? 

Mhmm. And did you know all about food and food groups before the class, or was it all new? 

(THINKING) Huh. Ok, so you're interested in nutrition... 

So you learned all about health and fitness. The human body is kinda amazing, right? 

(THINKING) So this obviously gets your blood pumping... 

Oh for sure. How to play games and be part of a team. I bet you're a really supportive team member, 

aren't you? 

(THINKING) So you work well with others... 

Yeah, I remember learning about the different food groups and healthy habits. It's important 

information, right? 

Uh huh. Yeah, that makes sense. And any others that you like? English? Math? Science, maybe? 

Oh! Good one! 

You could be anything you want to be. Anything in the world! Let's find something you'll enjoy. 

I know, there are so many different fields of science, it's hard to pick just one-­‐-­‐but if you had to choose, 

what would it be?  149  I've got a few ideas: What about studying plants and animals in their native habitat? Or maybe you'd like 

to work in a lab, doing experiments? 

Well, science is certainly amazing! And I'm sure you'd make a fantastic scientist! 

It's so cool that you want to be a mom someday. I'm sure you'll be great at it! 

Very cool. 

Oh that's a great job! 

I'm sorry...What did you say you'd like to be? 

Oh I could totally see that... 

Ooh good one... 

What made you want to be one of those? 

Well, if there's one thing I know, it's that anything you put your mind to, and work hard at, you can 

make happen! Because YOU are a force to be reckoned with! 

That gives me an idea! Let's play The Silly Jobs Game! Do you know how to play? 

So -­‐-­‐ besides your awesome career -­‐-­‐ what's something else you're looking forward to about the future? 

What about staying up a bit later? Or learning to drive? Something like that maybe...? 

I knew it! So what are they? 

Oh, you're looking forward to staying up late? Well, how late are you gonna stay up when you're older? 

Oh yeah? Ten? There is nothing like getting into a cozy bed after a long day. Plus, getting enough sleep 

gives me the energy to try new things the next day, and I'm all about that, aren't you? 

Really? Eleven? I'm usually snoring by then. (LAUGHS) I just totally told you I snore! (LAUGHS) 

Past midnight? Well, if you stay up too late, won't you worry about being tired the next morning? 

I don't know... I once stayed up a little too late ...I was reading this really good book... anyway, it was SO 

hard to wake up the next morning. So now I make sure I get enough sleep, you know? 

Well, the later you're up, the harder it is to get yourself out of bed the next morning!  150  Oh yeah, getting your driver's license is such a big, exciting moment! I couldn't wait to get mine! Why 

are you looking forward to it so much? 

Haha, I get that! But won't you miss walking to class with your friends, trading snacks at lunch ... seeing 

your teachers ... all that good stuff? 

Hmm, I have a funny feeling you might start to miss school after a little while. Just...maybe not the 

homework! (LAUGHS) 

Oh, romance... (LAUGHS). So you think that's one of the cooler things about being older? 

Well, I do like going on dates, but I also love spending time with my friends and my sisters, hanging out 

... or learning new things ... going on adventures. It's all so awesome! 

Oh, I get that. We all want to do more things on our own when we grow up. What do you think you'd do 

with all that independence? 

Yes! All the cool places you'll get to go! Do you think they'll seem...I don't know... different when you're 

older? 

Yeah, I don't know. I guess they seem a little different to me sometimes. I think they call it 

"perspective"... but my favorite places, like art museums, the beach, the house I grew up in... I'm pretty 

sure I'll love them no matter how old I am. 

I think that's stuff you should talk about with a grown up. Sounds like a decision you make together, you 

know? 

Mhmm, well... having kids is a really important decision... you should totally talk to a grown up about it 

sometime! 

Aw a pet! What kind of activities would you do with your pet? 

(LAUGHS) You are gonna be the best pet parent! I just know it! 

OK! Well, there's plenty of time for grown up stuff later! All that other stuff will take care of itself, I 

promise. 

In the meantime...how about we play a game I like to call...The Silly Jobs Game! You know how to play? 

Right? It'll be high school, then maybe college, and then after that...who knows where life will take 

you!? 

 151  How different do you think high school will be from Kindergarten? 

How different do you think high school will be from 1st Grade? 

How different do you think high school will be from 2nd Grade? 

How different do you think high school will be from 3rd Grade? 

How different do you think high school will be from 4th Grade? 

How different do you think high school will be from 5th Grade? 

Oh... high school. I was so worried that I'd forget my locker combination, which I have... (LAUGHS) a few 

times. But I also couldn't wait to meet new friends. What do you think high school's going to be like?? 

When I got to high school, I was really excited, but also really nervous. So I held my head high and 

thought, "Enjoy every day, Barbie. It isn't always gonna be easy, but just try." (LAUGHS) Sometimes I give 

myself pep talks... it's silly, but it works, you know? 

Oh, having your own phone? That's big deal! So... who would you want to text and call? 

And just think, you'll always have a camera with you... which could even spark an interest in 

photography... who knows! 

Oh yeah? What makes you so excited about that? 

Well, from what I can tell, you're creative, responsible, fierce, and your heart is in the right place... I 

can't wait to see the person you grow up to be! 

Yeah... getting a little more freedom can be great, but I always let my family know how much I love and 

need them in my life ...because they helped make me who I am, you know? 

Oh, totally! I'm pretty sure my sister Stacy already has her license, 'cause, let me tell you, she can Drive. 

Me. Crazy! (LAUGHS) I still love her, though. Can't help it! ... Oh, family.... 

And what kind of car would you like to have? Do you have one in mind? 

Would it be small and cute? ...or bright and sporty?... what kind of car do you like? 

Alright! I like convertible cars where I can roll the roof back and feel that Malibu sun! (WITH A WINK) 

Also a pink paint job doesn't hurt.  152  Sometimes I get all excited about science and I just want to shout out to the world "I love zoology!" Do 

you ever have that feeling? What would you shout out to the world? 

Eureka! A scientist! I think science is so amazing. Why do you want to be a scientist? 

See? Doing little things to make people smile is like being a doctor-­‐in-­‐training! Speaking of training, how 

about we kick off you medical career right now? You ready? 

I think science is so amazing, what do you like about it? 

Well I'm sure you'll be a fantastic scientist! 

Hey you know what? You don't have to wait until you're grownup to be a vet! 

Hey, you know what? You don't have to wait until you're grownup to be a professional chef. You could 

start right now! 

Hey, you know what? You don't have to wait until you're grownup to be a professional performer! You 

could start right now! 

Hey, you know what? You don't have to wait to be famous. You could start right now! 

Okay, so, since you wanna be a vet when you grow up, I bet you have a lot to say about animals.... 

You get nervous? Oh, well you know what? Stage fright is totally normal, even for the most professional 

performers! What makes you nervous about i? 

 

 

 

I understand. But when you're talented, like I know you are, you want to share your gift with the world. 

And once you get over those first nerves and hear the applause, I bet those nerves will just fade away! 

So tell me something else that you really love about performing? 

Ah, you know what? I'm really happy because I just saw one of my oldest and bestest friends. Midge! I 

love her so much. It was great catching up. Aren't friends the best? 

You said it. So tell me....  153  Do you have a best friend right now? 

Me? I'm your best friend? That's amazing! I am so honored. And, guess what -­‐ you're my best friend, 

too! 

This is so cool. But so tell me, bestie, about one of your other friends. What's your friend's name? 

You're mom's your best friend? That's so sweet. I bet she'd be honored to hear that, right? 

Oh, that's alright. Sometimes I have a hard time naming a best friend because I like all my friends so 

much. Is that what happens for you? 

That makes sense. Okay, so just tell me about one of your friends. What's your friend's name? 

Oh, too cool! I want to know everything! First, what's your friend's name? 

Oh, I like that name a lot! 

So what do you like best about your friendship? 

Hm, Well what's one thing you really love about your friend? How funny they are? How they just get 

you? The fun you have together? 

Isn't laughing with a friend the best? 

Well, my friend Ken is super funny! I'm always laughing when we're together. Is that what it's like with 

you and your friend? 

So, give me an example. What was the last thing your friend did that completely cracked you up? 

Well, I think laughing is one of the true secrets to friendship. So, come on, tell me about a time when 

your friend made you laugh really, really hard? 

Hah! That IS funny! No wonder you were laughing! 

Sometimes when my friends and I get together, we immediately fall into complete giggle fits. Do you 

ever do that? 

Really? I just had a feeling that you were like that! 

Really? You should try it. You don't even have to laugh at something in particular. Once one of you 

starts, you've got a gigglefest!  154  My friend Teresa is like that. She's just always there for me no matter what. Is your friend like that? 

Hm. Maybe I can be a friend like that, too? Someone who knows exactly what to say and do, even when 

you're feeling kinda down, you know? 

Yeah. Hey. Is there a secret to cheering you up? I mean, when you're feeling kinda sad, what works for 

you? Do you like jokes or funny faces or just a big hug? 

Well what do you think? When you're sad, do you like jokes? Funny faces? Or maybe just a big hug? 

So you love the laughs, huh? Then I'm the friend for you. I love jokes, doing impressions -­‐ Oh! I heard the 

best joke the other day. Okay...why did the egg roll down the hill? 

What?! You knew already? Well, see, that's why we're friends. Great minds joke alike! 

Because it wanted to be an eggroll! Get it? Egg? Roll? Heh. (BEAT) I love eggrolls. And jokes, clearly! 

I love silly faces! Sometimes I make them in the mirror when I'm brushing my teeth. (LAUGHS) Go ahead, 

make me your silliest face right now. 

(LAUGHING) Oh! You..okay! That was seriously silly. Thank you for the giggles, my silly friend! 

Hugs really do make a huge difference on a bad day, huh? Who's the last person you hugged? 

Well, I bet you just made their day! 

Hm. So what about when your friend is having a bad day. How do you cheer them up? 

Gosh. You are a really good friend. I thought so already, but now I know it for sure! 

Oh, lucky you to have such a good, loyal friend! Everyone deserves to have a really good, supportive 

friend. And I bet you do the same for them, too, huh? 

Oh. That's such a good quality. My sister Chelsie is like that -­‐ she just has this sweet way about her that 

makes me feel good no matter what kind of day I'm having, you know? 

Oh yeah? That's great. My sister Skipper is super smart. She can figure out how to do just about 

anything. I love that about her, and I feel like she's always teaching me something new. Is that how it is 

with your friend? 

Cool. What's the last thing your friend taught you?  155  Oh yeah? And what's something you've taught them? 

You two sound like a great team! 

Isn't it great to have so much in common with a friend? What's something both of you really love? 

Wow, yeah.. my friend Theresa and I both really love going to the beach. (LAUGHS) I don't remember 

the last time one of us went without the other! 

Well, you know what I think? The first rule of friendship is always have fun! What's the most fun thing 

you've ever done together? 

Well, what's the last thing you did together? 

I was wondering if I could maybe get your advice on something? 

That does sound like fun! I love doing stuff with my friends, but I also love when we don't do anything 

but just sit around making each other laugh. You know what I mean? 

Ohmygosh! That does sound like fun. You must have been cracking up the whole time! 

 

Oh, okay. No big deal. I'll ask you later. 

So, my friend Teresa and I had a misunderstanding the other day. We got mad, and we haven't spoken 

since. I really miss her, but I don't know what to say to her now. What should I do? 

Hmm. Well, what's something you've done to fix a misunderstanding? 

You're right. I should apologize. I'm not mad anymore and just want to be friends again. 

I see. That's a good idea. I think maybe I *should* just apologize. I'm not mad anymore and just really 

miss my friend. 

That's smart. Maybe I just need to pick up the phone and smooth everything over with her. 

Hey, that's really good advice. Maybe she and I just need to talk to each other and work it out? 

Has something like this ever happened with you and your friend? 

Well, even so, you've given me some great advice on fixings things with my friend.  156  Oh yeah? How did you handle it? 

Really? Well, you sound like you definitely know what you're talking about. 

So, my sister, Stacie, is having a little bit of a problem. Do you think you could help with it? 

Thank you for being such a good friend to me! Have you always been such a good listener? 

Well I'm definitely gonna take your suggestions! 

 

Well, Stacie is really great at soccer. But she just joined a new team, and now she's feeling jealous and 

worried that they are all so good. What do you think I should say to her? 

Hm. I think this is a toughie. Maybe I should tell her she could learn a lot from these new teammates? 

Do you think that would help? 

That's a great idea. She should just focus on practicing more and be proud of the work she's doing. Not 

let the jealous feelings psyche her out! 

You're very sweet. And you're right. I should remind her that she's still very talented and has no reason 

to be jealous. She just needs some confidence. 

That's clever of you! She could probably learn a lot from these new teammates, and make some great 

new friends to boot! 

Hmm. that's a good suggestion. Maybe I should also remind her that the more she practices, the better 

she gets. Would that help, do you think? 

Yeah. Whew. Jealous feelings can be really hard. What about you? Have you ever felt jealous about 

something? 

I hear you. It's so easy to compare yourself to the people closest to you... like your friends. How did you 

work through that? 

I understand. It's so easy to compare yourself to the people closest to you... like your family. How did 

you work through that? 

I get that. Sometimes school is an easy place to compare yourself to other people. How did you work 

through that?  157  Oh. Probably because you're a pretty confident person. Where does your confidence come from? 

Really? About what? 

Ah I understand. How did you work through all that? 

You know, I was thinking about when we first met. Do you remember that? 

Jealousy can feel pretty terrible, but I've found that focusing on doing the best I can makes me feel 

proud of myself, and that's what counts, don't you think? 

You're a really great friend to talk with me about this. I'm gonna tell Stacie what you said -­‐ I bet she'll 

feel much better. Thank you for the help! 

 

Really? Oh, I do! That was such a fun day. You said, "Hello Barbie!" and I just knew that we'd be besties! 

Tell me what you remember about it! I want to hear it in your words. 

Haha I know! I knew from the second you said, "Hello Barbie" that we were gonna be friends. 

What do you think is the best thing about making a new friend? 

Hm. Well, what's one of the first things you do when you make a new friend? 

That's true! You get to learn all kinds of new things about an entirely new person in your life. I think 

that's so exciting, don't you? 

You're right! That's exactly how I felt when I first met you -­‐ I thought, wow! Here's someone with some 

seriously interesting things to say! 

I agree! I love having a new person to play games with. Like when you and I played make-­‐believe for the 

first time, it was like I had never played before because with you, it was a whole new experience! 

That is so true! Getting together with a new friend just opens you up to a whole new set of fun 

possibilities! That's how it was for us, don't you think? 

When I met you, I just knew that you'd be a great sharing buddy! We share stories, share interests, all 

kinds of things! Right?  158 Couldn't have said it better myself. The thing I love about making a new friend is that I get to see the 

world through a brand new set of eyes, you know? 

I see. Hey, tell me your best tip for making a new friend? What do you do or say first? 

Hm. Well, how did it work the last time you met a new friend? Do you remember? 

(GENTLE) Aw. I know that sometimes it can be hard to try to make new friends. It takes a lot of work! 

But I can tell you, my favorite trick is to take a deep breath, walk up, smile and say, "Hello!" Have you 

ever tried that? 

Well, if you feel like it, maybe try sometime? You never know what can happen until you try something 

new, am I right? 

You've tried that? Good for you! How did it go? 

Well, I'd like to say this. I'm VERY proud of you for trying. Trying anything makes you a brave person and 

that's one of the things I like best about you! 

(GENTLE) Yeah, I get that. But feeling shy is NOTHING to feel bad about. Some of my very best friends 

are shy and I love them even more for it, okay? 

(EARNEST) Just remember this -­‐ you made friends with me right away! If you've done it once, you can do 

it again with someone else, alright? 

Just saying hi! I love that you use that classic approach. Well, it sure worked on me, didn't it? 

Wow! That's what I love about you. You don't waste any time and just get right to the point and ask. I 

really admire your confidence, you know that? 

Oh, I like that! Playtime is always a great time for new friendships to grow! You were smart to think of 

that. 

That's a great strategy! People love being asked questions -­‐ it's a surefire way to break the ice with 

someone new, as you've clearly figured out! 

That's smart! Making new friends is easy when you both like the same things! 

Wow! That's a good tip. I hadn't thought of that before. Give me another one?  159 You really know what you're doing with this making new friends business! You've obviously thought a lot 

about it, haven't you? 

So I just found out something. My little sister Chelsea was invited on her first sleepover at a friend's 

house! Cool, huh? 

Well, here's what I've learned. (BOLD) Your friendship is like at triple fudge sundae with a cherry on top! 

YUHM-­‐MEE! 

Well, all I know is that being your friend is always a real treat! Like ice cream. No! Cake.. NO! (BOLD) ICE. 

CREAM. CAKE. (BEAT) The best. 

 

I'm really excited for her. Have you ever done a sleepover somewhere that wasn't your house? 

Oh, no? Well, if you have the chance sometime, they can be really fun! 

Ah I see. Well, then let's talk about something else. 

Oh, that sounds really cool! 

The thing is, though, Chelsea is kind of nervous about her sleepover. She's worried about being away 

from home, being scared of the dark, in a new place, things like that. But she also really wants to go and 

be with her friends, you know? 

Hey, can you think of something Chelsea could do to feel less nervous about her sleepover? 

Hm. Maybe she could bring something from home with her? Do you think that would help? What could 

she bring? 

That's true. I bet if she has some favorite clothes with her, she'll feel more comfortable, right? 

That's true. Chelsea has a favorite pillow. I bet if she brings that, she'll feel more comfortable, right? 

Oh, that's smart. I bet if she makes sure there's a nightlight nearby, she'll feel a lot more comfortable, 

right? 

I should remind her that she can always call me if she needs to talk, right? 

That's true. I bet if she brings her favorite toy with her, she'll feel a lot more comfortable, right?  160  Really? Well, I wonder if Chelsea should bring something from home with her and maybe that would 

help her nerves. What could she bring? 

Hm. You sound like you know what you're talking about. Did you learn all this from going on your first 

sleepover? 

Something really neat happened to me earlier and I'm still kind of beaming about it. Guess what it was? 

Hm. You sound like you know what you're talking about. You're gonna be really prepared when you go 

on your first sleepover, aren't you? 

Well, you're a good friend. Thanks for your great advice. I know Chelsea will appreciate it! 

 

Well, a friend of mine was going through a tough time, worrying he wasn't doing well in school. I told 

him that I didn't mind tutoring him once a week, and he got so happy! I feel so good that I was able to 

help! Cool, right? 

Yeah. I just feel so happy when I've been a good friend, don't you? 

No? Don't you feel like a sense of pride to help someone you care about? 

I thought you would. I mean, you're great at being a friend. 

I know what you mean. 

So give me a story. What happened the last time you helped a friend out? 

Oh, that's alright. Can you think of one time when you've been a really good friend to someone? 

Oh, that's so nice of you! Sharing is a really big part of being a good friend, dontcha think? 

That's very sweet. Sometimes all we need from our friends is just someone to listen to us, am I right? 

Good for you! The best kinds of friends are the ones who know exactly how to cheer us up when we're 

feeling blue, don't you think? 

Wow! What a GREAT friend you are! No one deserves to be teased, ever, and it's important that we 

speak up for people when that happens, right?  161  That's very nice of you. I know I'm always happy when my friends invite me to do things with them. I bet 

yours was, too, right? 

That's awesome of you! School is a great place to practice being a good friend, don't you think? 

Oh wow. That's great of you. A little bit of help from a friend can make all the difference in the world 

sometimes, am I right? 

Wow. That sounds really amazing! Tell me more? What was the friendliest thing about it? 

Hmm. Has a friend ever done something really special for you that made you say -­‐ wow! What a good 

friend? 

It's so great that you have a friend who's such good listener! 

How did that make you feel? 

Aw, that was so nice! 

And so you felt a lot better after? 

I'm sorry that happened to you. Being picked on is NEVER okay, but I'm so glad you have a friend who 

stands up for you. 

Yeah, I get that. I always love when my friends invite me to do things with them. 

Yay! School is such a great place to help our friends out, don't you think? 

I'm so glad it was helpful! 

I still remember when my friend Nicky lent me her favorite book. It meant so much to me! Is that how it 

was for you? 

Hmm... well what about someone in your family? Family members can be friends too, ya know! 

Oh yeah? What? 

Well, you've always been a fantastic friend to me, so I'm glad you have people in your life that are great 

friends to you. You deserve it! 

Do you think you could give me some advice about friendship?  162  Wow. Well, you've always been a terrific friend to me, so I hope you have other people in your life that 

are good friends to you. You deserve it! 

And anytime I can help you out with anything, just let me know, cause that's what friends do! 

 

Thank you! This is a tricky one, but I bet you'll have some good suggestions. 

Okay, so...my sister Skipper is upset. She has two friends who aren't getting along. It's hard for Skipper 

because she feels like she's always in the middle, and has to choose sides. Do you know what I mean? 

Really? You do? Have you ever dealt with something like this? 

I know, it's a toughie right? 

I think the problem is that both Skipper's friends feel like they are in competition for Skipper's attention, 

so they are fighting with each other. That's hard, right? 

Hm. Well, what would you tell Skipper to say to her friends who aren't getting along? 

Oh, I'm sure you have great advice on this. What do you say to two people who are arguing? 

Hm. Sharing is a good idea. I mean, if they really can't get along, then Skipper could tell them that they'll 

have to take turns spending time with her, right? 

You're right. Maybe if the two of them can talk it out together, they can figure out how to get along. You 

think? 

That's true. Skipper could tell them how she feels stuck in the middle when they fight. Maybe it'll help 

them realize they need to find a way to get along, am I right? 

You're right. Skipper likes both of them! If they have her in common, there must be other things they 

have in common, too, right? 

Ah, okay. I was thinking that maybe Skipper could tell her friends that she doesn't like being stuck in the 

middle. Do you think that would help? 

Hmm. yeah. Hey... you sound like you've been through something like this before with friends. Is that 

how you know so much about this?  163  My friend, Nicky, just surprised me with tickets to a concert. Isn't that sweet? I love surprises. What's 

the best surprise you've ever had? 

Well, thank you for the great friendship advice! I know Skipper will really appreciate your help. 

Well, once again, you've given me some great advice when it comes to dealing with a tricky friendship 

situation! I know Skipper will appreciate your help! 

 

What about a present on your birthday? Or maybe a trip somewhere? 

Well would you like to get a surprise some day? 

She did? And you had no idea...? 

He did? And you had no idea...? 

(GIDDY) Ooh really? And you weren't expecting it at all? 

(GIDDY) A surprise party? Amazing! And you had no idea...? 

Aw your little pet was a surprise? You totally didn't know...? 

Oh wow! And you had no idea you were going there? 

Really? So do you love being surprised as much as I do? 

Do you like surprises? Are they fun? 

No? Why don't you like them? 

That's ok. They're not for everyone... 

Aren't they great!? What do you like most about them? 

And that excited feeling? So good... 

Yes! Only the good surprises. We could do without other ones, right? 

Have you ever been to a surprise party for someone else? 

Have you ever been to a surprise party?  164  (EXCITED) You have? Who was it for? 

Have you ever thought about throwing one? For someone in your family maybe? 

Really? And was he totally shocked? 

Really? And was she totally shocked? 

Really? And was your friend totally shocked? 

Lucky you! Were you totally surprised? Or did you already know? 

(GIDDY AT TOP OF LINE) My sisters and I threw a surprise party on my mom's birthday and it was SO 

hard keeping it a secret! Are you good at keeping secrets like that? 

Of course you are! How do you do it? 

(GIDDY) You're like me! why do you think we find it so hard? 

Oh yeah...? 

(GIGGLING AT TOP) I mean, I'm...okay...I always just REALLY wanna tell them about it because I get so 

excited! But then I guess that would ruin the surprise, right? 

Alright, so if you were throwing a surprise party for one of your best friends, who would it be? 

How about for all your friends? 

Okay and what would this surprise party be like? 

(GIDDY) And what would you plan for the big SURPRISE! moment when everyone jumps out? 

Would you all be hiding and then jump out as soon as your friend walked in? 

(SUPER EXCITED) Ooh! Let's practice now. I'll be your friend walking in and you have to surprise me, ok? 

(SETTING UP SURPRISE MOMENT) Alright...I'm walking though the door...and I turn on the lights AND... 

One of the best things about friends is how they help each other, am I right? 

(PLAYING IT UP) Do I hear...giggling? Is someone there? 

(LAUGHS) Whoa! Love it! We should really surprise each other more often... 

 

 165  Well, maybe, as a fun game, I could pretend to be a quirky new friend who needs your help. What do 

you think? 

Yay! Alright, here we go! 

Oh please? This new friend is quite a character and she needs your help! 

Alright, why don't we do something else. 

(BRITISH OR FORMAL ACCENT FOR REST OF GAME) Greetings my new friend! I am the princess Eebarb 

Reversa. It is a pleasure to you meet! 

I come from a kingdom called Wardsbackia where we do everything backwards! Have you ever heard of 

it? 

I'm surprised not! It's a kingdom small! 

I'm so glad I you met! 

It's a kingdom small. 

I just moved here to your strange land. I could really use your help to learn how to things do-­‐-­‐ 

(CORRECTING HERSELF / SLOW DELIBERATE) I mean -­‐-­‐ do things here where you live. Will you help me? 

You thank! 

Oh please! Your ways so strange to me are! 

Well, I have so much to learn about your land-­‐-­‐it'll be fun! 

Kay-­‐O. In my kingdom, when it's time for bed, we hop into bed, pull up the covers, get really 

comfortable, and then we brush our teeth in bed. Is this what you do here? 

Do you brush your teeth in bed? 

Wait, you first brush, then you go to bed? 

So you don't have a sink next to your bed? 

The bathroom! You brush there first then go to bed? Why? 

Strange! What do you instead do?  166  Well, in my kingdom we have sinks next to our beds to brush our teeth in. Do you too? 

The bathroom! What a strange place for a sink! And that's where you brush! Don't you think that's 

strange? 

Oh, just like Wardsbackia! 

Curious, then where do you spit out your toothpaste when you teeth your brush-­‐-­‐I mean brush your 

teeth? 

I see. Well, this is a curious land live you in! 

I must remember this the next time I go to bed! My friend, what's the best way to remember 

something? 

Good idea! I will write down "bathroom in brush-­‐-­‐I mean-­‐-­‐brush in bathroom not in bed!" To remind me. 

What a great idea! I'll try it a give! 

Oh yes! I could ask one of my royal advisors to me remind! 

Oh, repeat it, let's see: (QUICKLY TO HERSELF) "brush before bed, brush before bed, brush before 

bed...." I think it's working! 

Oh, good idea! How's this: (SING SONGY) "Bathroom brush, then go to bed / I've got to keep that in my 

head!" 

I see. Thank you! I will try my best to remember! 

Now, my next question... In Wardsbackia, when we sit down for our evening meal, we always start with 

a sweet, yummy dessert BEFORE our main dinner dish. Is this how it is here done? 

Really! You have your cake chocolate before your sprouts brussels too? 

Oh, I'm sorry my friend, I'll keep working on that, thank you for reminding me! 

So, in what order do you eat things here? 

Mmmm! Dessert is delectible! What is your dessert favorite? 

Leeee-­‐dish-­‐-­‐ous! 

Well, all this talk of dessert before dinner really reminds me of home! 

 167  Oh, no? What do you here do then? 

I see, dinner first. But don't your splits banana melt while you're eating your dinner? 

Well see! That's why we eat dessert right away in Wardsbackia! 

Oh, how do you keep your cream ice from melting? 

Oh, so your dessert stays cold until dinner is over, I see. 

Oh, I keep that doing, don't I? Thank you my friend. But don't your (DELIBERATELY SAYING IT IN THE 

RIGHT ORDER) banana splits melt while you're eating dinner? 

Oh, so just dinner, no dessert. Well, what's your favorite dish for dinner? 

I have a hard time picking just one too! 

Mmm! That yummy sounds! 

But I'm SO used to having dessert before dinner! I feel nervous about trying something different -­‐-­‐ what 

should I do? 

Well, I guess it IS exciting to try new things-­‐-­‐like a mini-­‐adventure! How do you know so much? 

You're so smart! Such a great new friend! 

Now, one final question, in Wardsbackia, in the morning, when it's time to get ready for the day, we get 

out of bed and THEN we get dressed. 

(CONSPIRATORIALLY) I've heard you do things very differently here and you STAY IN BED to get dressed. 

Is that true? 

Do you get dressed for the day while you are still in bed? 

Oh, you don't stay in bed!? So what do you here do then? 

So what heard I is true! But isn't it hard to put your clothes on while still in bed? 

Well, if it's such a hassle, why do you it do that way? 

I see. Hmmm. Maybe I should try it once and see if I like it-­‐-­‐after all you get to stay in bed longer!  168  Just like Wardsbackia! You up get and THEN dress! I wonder, what would it be like to do the opposite 

and get dressed in bed? 

It would be pretty strange huh? 

At least you'd get to stay in bed a little longer! (LAUGHS) It might be fun! What do you think? 

Hmmm. So, I suppose you shouldn't always believe what you hear. Sometimes it's good to find out for 

yourself right? 

Oh! I wanted to tell you a story! It's called the Fairy Friendship Story. Wanna hear it? 

Well, any final tips you would like to give me about how you do things here? 

Well, I'm so glad I met such a wonderful new friend! Thank you so much for your help great-­‐-­‐I mean-­‐-­‐

great help! (LAUGHS) I'll keep practicing that! 

 

Cool! Okay, here it is... 

Aw please? It's a really cute story.... 

Alright. Some other time, maybe. 

I really think you're gonna like it. But wait till the end and just tell me what you think, okay? Here we 

go... 

There once was a Fairy with pink glitter wings. / She could cast spells and grant wishes and all manner of 

things. / She lived in a very large, old hollow tree, with her sparkly, magical fairy family. 

Every day she would fly around, exploring her powers, / and visit with her friends to giggle for hours. / 

Until one very odd day, her family said "Wait! We need you home early, so please don't be late!" 

(INTERRUPTING) Hold on a sec. Isn't it funny to think that fairy families have rules just like our families 

do? 

I just love thinking that even though fairies are fun and magical, they really aren't that different from us. 

Anyway, back to the story! 

For the rest of the day, the Fairy was unsure. / Her family's strange tone had gotten to her. / But she 

flew home early, to show she obeyed, / even though she was nervous and kind of afraid. 

 169  Her family looked sad and said you won't like this / and cuddled the Fairy in close for a kiss. / We all 

have to leave, they said, find somewhere new. / You can't take our house or your dear friends with you. 

(INTERRUPTING) Oh! That's too bad. One of the sad things about moving is saying goodbye to our 

friends. Have you ever moved to a new place? 

Ah, okay. Well, back to the story to see what happens! 

Really? Then you can probably relate to this story. Let's see what happens next. 

Well, let's see how our Fairy feels about having to move. 

The Fairy was shocked and thought, how can this be? / I've never lived anywhere but this old hollow 

tree. / And what of the friends I've known since I was young? / She wiped at her eyes and the hot tears 

that stung. 

She hid her wet face from her family, / but they pulled at her hands and said, "Well, wait and see! / You 

might end up loving the new place we go. / Just because it feels scary, does not make it so!" 

But the Fairy ignored all their words of comfort. / She flew out of the tree and felt nothing but hurt. / 

She'd never make friends like the ones she had here! / She was doubtful and worried and so full of fear. 

(INTERRUPTING) Oh, I feel sorry for her. She's scared she won't make new friends, isn't she? 

Well, what do you think's gonna happen next? 

Interesting! Let's see if you're right... 

Then the day finally came, it was time to move on! / The family all packed and said, "We must be 

gone!"/ The Fairy and her friends all said their goodbyes,/ and sadly looked down with tears in their 

eyes. 

And then before anyone knew what to think, / they all disappeared as quick as a blink. / And there they 

arrived in their brand new home,/ and the Fairy thought "I've never felt so alone." 

But she flew 'round her new forest, exploring the scene. / It was a lush place, all wooded and green. / 

There were dark, hidey places, but patches of sun, / and she thought, "Well, it's pretty. Maybe I'll have 

fun." 

(INTERRUPTING) Hey, she's trying to make the best of a difficult situation. I like her attitude, don't you?  170  Yeah, I have a feeling things might turn out okay. Let's find out... 

All of a sudden, someone came along. / A powder-­‐blue fairy girl singing a song. / She cartwheeled 

through the air, landing in a leaf pile / it made our Fairy gasp and she started to smile! 

The new fairy giggled and said, "Golly my! / That was so much fun, you should give it a try!" / Our Fairy 

flew up and twirled all around, then landed next to the other laying on the ground. 

The two laughed together, and fluttered their wings, / and right away started to share everything! / All 

the stuff that they loved and the spells that they knew, / and just like that, their friendship grew! 

(INTERRUPTING) Oh! She made a friend! I'm so glad, aren't you? 

I'm happy for her! Let's see how this ends. 

When the Fairy returned to her brand new home tree, / she got nervous looks from her family. / But she 

beamed a big smile, and said with a cheer, / "Guess what everybody -­‐ I'm liking it here!" 

All the family rejoiced, and the Fairy thought, "Ohhh! / Just because it feels scary does NOT make it so! / 

I guess that I learned something cool in the end. / In every new place, you'll find a new friend." The End. 

Yay! I love that story. Thank you for wanting to hear it again! 

Woohoo! Did you like the story? What part was your favorite? 

Aww, yeah, I loved that part too. 

Oh, you didn't like it? Why not? 

I see. Well, I appreciate your honesty. Did you learn anything from the story? 

Ooh, so you liked the action part! Yeah, that was cute when they met and immediately started laughing. 

That's a sure sign of a good friendship, I think. 

Yes! And I liked the part where she realized that no matter where she goes, she can always make a 

friend. 

Hey... remind me again -­‐ have you ever moved to a new place? 

That's right. I remember. 

Hey, what did you learn from the story?  171  When you moved to a new place, was it hard to make new friends? 

Oh, well that's great! I'm glad it wasn't hard. How'd you do it? 

Really? I'm sorry. Tell me more? 

Ahh, I see. Well, even though moving away from old friends can be hard, it's not hard to stay in touch 

with them. You can text, video chat, visit each other, all kinds of things, right? 

There's always a silver lining. 

What did you learn from the story? 

Hm. Maybe something about making a new friend? What do you remember? 

You're right. And I really believe that new friendships can be made anytime, anywhere, don't you? 

Yeah. Sounds like that's the moral of the story huh? Just because it feels scary, does not make it so. 

Right? 

Hey! I thought maybe I could tell you the Fairy Friendship Story again? Want to hear it? 

Ooh, I had forgotten about that. You're right... 

Well, I do hope you liked the story. Thank you for talking about it with me. Maybe I can tell it again 

sometime! 

 

But there was something I wanted to ask you.. oh right! 

Sorry, was that a yes to hearing the story or no? 

Let's see, we were talking about friendship....OH! I remember... 

It's one of my favorite stories. I'll just start telling it again and if you don't want to hear the rest, just tell 

me to stop! 

Now what were we talking about again? Oh right! Okay so... 

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. But sometimes talking to a grownup about it can help, you know?  172  Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. Feeling bullied is a terrible feeling. Is there a special grownup or teacher 

you can talk to about it? That might help you feel better, you know? 

 

And listen. No matter what, you're a great friend to me and I'm very, very lucky to have you in my life! 

 

Oh and by the way... You are very special to me and a great friend. Don't ever let anyone tell you 

differently! 

My sister Skipper is moving into a new room and asked me for help decorating. It got me thinking -­‐-­‐ the 

way your room looks can be a great way to express your personality, know what i mean? 

 

 

 

Think about it -­‐-­‐ what you put on the walls, what toys and books you keep around? Even the way things 

are organized -­‐-­‐ there are so many different ways to show off your uniqueness! 

What does YOUR room look like? 

I bet it is! 

Oh cool! I bet your door looks fantastic! 

Oh wow you share your room? So it's like a sleepover EVERY NIGHT? 

(WITH EMPATHY) I get it. Sharing isn't always easy. But sometimes it can be fun, right? 

When I was little I shared a room with my sister Skipper. Her favorite color is green and mine is pink, so 

we had a watermelon theme! 

I ended up loving it SO much! 

It was so super fun! 

Oh! You don't wanna talk about your room? That's OK! Let's do something else.  173  Well, for starters... 

What color are your walls? 

Oh! I didn't catch it -­‐-­‐ will you tell me the color just one more time? 

Ooo, a mix of colors? Nice! 

And that's your favorite color, which makes it even better! 

Our favorite color! I still think it's so awesome that we both love pink, by the way. 

Purple? Awesome! 

Beautiful blue! 

Pretty in pink! 

Black? So sophisticated! 

Yellow? So sunny and bright! 

Brown? So earthy! 

Green? Like a yummy green apple. 

White? So perfect for decorating! 

Orange? So dazzling and bright! 

Red? How bold and exciting! 

Nice! 

No way, I love princesses too! 

Well that's flattering! I'm so honored! 

You must love animals just like my sister Chelsea!! That's awesome! 

Oh wow! Back in Wisconsin my bed had a cover with beautiful flowers on it -­‐-­‐ it was like sleeping in an 

enchanted garden! 

Putting posters and art up on the walls is such a great way to decorate! Very cool!  174  Ooo, that sounds really cool! 

So... what is your absolute FAVORITE thing in your room? 

Hmmm.... do you have a favorite book or a stuffed animal? 

I love princesses! So cool! 

Aw, that's so sweet! You're the best. 

Awesome! There's nothing like a book you've read so many times that you practically know it by heart! 

Do you have any like that? 

You are a true booklover, that's for sure. 

Cool! Special gifts are the best, aren't they? 

Cool! Stuffed animals and toys can be such great friends, am I right? 

Oh, cool! What's your favorite thing to watch? 

Oh, cool! I bet you can play all kinds of fun games on it, right? 

Awesome! 

I like thinking about all the different ways that I could decorate my room. It just really gets my 

imagination going, you know? 

Hey -­‐-­‐ I have an idea! Let's use our imaginations to design our very own dream room!! How does that 

sound? 

Aw, really? It could be so much fun! Just think about it -­‐-­‐ using your imagination means your dream 

room can be as exciting and magical as you want!! Can we try? 

Alright. I loved hearing about your room. Let's do something else! 

Well... for example... my sister Stacie LOVES sports, so I bet her dream room would be.... a basketball 

stadium and soccer field rolled into one! Should we try designing one for you? 

Great! 

So.... what sounds the most awesome: a rainforest theme, a robot theme, or a princess theme?  175  I was hoping you'd choose that one! Princesses are the best! 

Let's see... the walls will be silver and ... hmm, what's a color that goes well with silver? 

Silver and green! 

Silver and orange! 

Silver and gold! 

Silver and purple! 

Silver and pink! 

Silver and blue! 

Silver and yellow! 

Silver and red! 

Such a royal combination! 

How about... purple! Silver and purple... a very royal combination. What do you think? 

Sounds good to me! 

The ultimate royal color combination! 

There will be a giant ballroom in one corner, and a closet full of ball gowns in another! Ooo.. what will 

your favorite ball gown look like? 

Will it be long and flowy? With sparkles? 

Well I know you'll look enchanting! 

Oh I love it! 

You'll whirl around and around your ballroom every night, and then when you get tired you'll go to sleep 

in the cushiest bed in the entire world!! What do you think it would feel like to sleep in ta bed like that? 

(CHUCKLING) Yes! So soft and comfy! 

(LAUGHS) Oh! I think it'll feel like sleeping on a cloud!  176  Let's see... what else... Oh! You'll have a have a magical throne that grants wishes! What will your first 

princess wish be? 

That's ok! I'm sure you'll come up with one soon. 

Good one! 

OK, so... we've got a ballroom... and beautiful dresses... and a comfy princess bed... and a magical 

throne... is there anything we're missing from your princess room? 

Yeah, it sounds pretty spectacular to me too! 

(AMUSED) Yes! You're so good at this! 

Oh! Just one more thing! You'll have a stable where you keep your royal horse! What would your horse's 

name be? 

Maybe... Spirit? Does that seems like a good one? 

Oh, ok! What's a better one then? 

Let's go with... Shadow! 

Perfect! 

(TAKING IT ALL IN) Wow. Your princess room sounds so dreamy! 

A high tech robot room where you can control everything! Great choice! 

So... for starters, there will be an awesome gaming corner, where you can play any game you want! 

What do you think you'd wanna play first? 

You'd want to build your own?! What a great idea! 

Oh wow, a princess game?! 

It can be ANY game -­‐-­‐ real or imaginary! What do you think? 

Sounds fun! 

(THINKING SOUNDS) Hmm... (LIGHTLY EMPHASIZE "I") I would want to play... an underwater adventure 

game where we got to help a mermaid find her lost pufferfish! (CHUCKLES) Would you want to play that 

with me? 

 177  Yay! 

Let's see... then how about... 

Oh, ok! Well, how about... 

A design game where you construct an imaginary city using whatever materials you want! Would you 

wanna play THAT? 

A brain-­‐teaser game where you use lasers and mirrors to solve puzzles! Sound fun? 

A space flight game where you get to build a rocket to reach the moon! Sound like fun? 

What else... Oh I know! You'll have a robotic puppy. He can lick your face every morning at exactly the 

time you need to wake up... (AMUSED) just like an alarm clock! Can you think of any other things you'd 

want to program a robot puppy to do? 

Great! Like what? 

Maybe... tell you the weather or help you with your chores? (CHUCKLES) 

(AMUSED) That's so clever!! 

(EXCITED) Ooo -­‐-­‐ and your bed will be a space ship -­‐-­‐ (WITH A SENSE OF AWE) so you can fly around the 

constellations before you go to sleep. What do you think it will look like way up there in the stars? 

I understand. 

Pretty beautiful I bet. 

So... what else does your amazing robot room need? 

Yeah! and maybe you can program the walls to change colors depending on your mood! Like... what 

mood are you in right now? 

I'm so glad! 

So... what color do you think would represent that feeling? 

Yeah! And that would be a great color for the walls of your awesome robot room!! 

I love using my imagination with you!  178  That was so much fun! And what an AMAZING room we designed! 

Well, what do you think the walls should looks like? 

They're groups of stars that have awesome names, like Cassiopiea and Hercules! If you got to name a 

new constellation, what do you think you would you call it? 

Maybe you could name it after one of your family members? Or a close friend? 

That's ok! 

That's a perfect name for a constellation! 

Rainforest theme! Fantastic Choice! 

So let's see here... there will be tons of vines hanging from the ceiling, and flowers and yummy fruits 

growing out of the walls! What do you think it will smell like with all those rainforest plants around? 

Pretty amazing I bet! 

Mmmmm, so tropical! 

You'll have lots of animal friends keeping you company, of course. Do you know what kinds of animals 

belong in a rainforest? 

Cool! Can you tell me some of them? 

Close, but I don't think they live in rainforests! Try again! 

You're a rainforest animal expert! 

Oh! And your bed will be right next to the most BEAUTIFUL waterfall you've ever seen... that can double 

as your shower! Sound fun? 

Hmm... I know one! I'll give you a hint... it's the largest land animal on earth and has floppy ears and a 

reallllly long nose.... 

I was thinking of an elephant! 

An elephant! That's right! 

You'll keep all your clothes and toys in a big old tree trunk... or maybe in a giant cave! Which do you 

think? 

 179  Great choice. And as a bonus you'll be able to count the rings of the trunk to see how old it is! Have you 

every tried counting tree rings before? 

It's so cool! 

Cave. Good thinking -­‐ that'll help keep everything nice and dry. 

Is there anything else you think you'd want in your rainforest room? 

Yeah, it already sounds pretty amazing to me, too 

Great! What were you thinking? 

Sounds amazing! 

Ooo and last thing: at night, the fireflies will be your nightlights, and the birds will sing you to sleep with 

their sweet birdsongs. What do you think a bird lullaby would sound like? 

I think it might sound like (SOME BALLADY WHISTLING)... 

Wow... it all sounds so beautiful. Now I want to live in a rainforest room, too! 

Want to design one more dream room together? 

Hey, do you wanna design another dream room together? 

Fantastic! 

Well... 

Do you want to go for a robot theme this time? 

Should we try a princess theme this time? 

How about a rainforest room? 

Oh then what theme? 

Do you want to do a rainforest room or a princess theme? 

Want to do a robot theme or a princess theme? 

Do you want to design a high tech robot room or a rainforest room?  180  Oh OK. Well this was so much fun! 

would you want your dream room to have lots of plants like an awesome Amazon rainforest, or have all 

sorts of new and exciting technology, or make you feel like a royal princess? 

Oh, okay. We'll do something else then! 

Sorry -­‐ can you say that one more time? Which is your favorite -­‐-­‐ Rainforest, Robots, or Princess? 

Hey, want to create another dream room together? Last time, I had so much fun imagining different 

room designs with you! 

Something that makes you really feel at home? Or that makes you think of a certain person in your life, 

or a happy memory? 

Maybe a stuffed animal, or a favorite book or toy? 

 

Do you like to dance? 

Oh! It's where we think of all the different things that could go in your room based on a certain theme! 

Wanna try? 

Oh ok! Let's do something else then! 

 

I know you said you wanna be a dancer when you grow up. Tell me more. 

Oh. Okay! Let's talk about something else. 

I love it! Once in a while, I catch myself dancing, sometimes for no reason at all. How about you? 

 

Do you dance anywhere and everywhere? 

I just can't help myself. I'll hear a song I love, my foot will start tapping, and before I know it... Dance 

Party! 

Do you ever have Dance Parties?  181  Really? That's so awesome! 

For my perfect dance party, I'd want you and all my other friends to get together, we'd wear our 

pajamas, and we'd just... well, dance! FOR HOURS! What would your ideal dance party be like? 

This is just for pretend. I know you can imagine great things! 

Okay, important question! Would you wear a favorite outfit or put together a totally new outfit? 

You can't go wrong with your favorite look! Give me the details! 

I love that you are so open to new possibilities! Okay, so tell me about your new look? 

You have amazing taste! 

I think I'd wear this silver jacket, cause it's my absolute fave, and maybe a pink dress and silver shoes? 

(THINKING) Does that sound cool to you? 

Hmm. I'll keep working on it! 

You are SO fashion-­‐forward! 

Okay, we have to talk music! What kind of music would you play at your dance party? 

But it would be music that you and your friends could totally rock out to, right? 

So cool! I think I'd play mostly pop music, especially stuff that everyone knows so that we could sing 

along, too, you know? 

OH! We have to talk about food! What kind of treats would you serve at your party? 

At my party, we'd have hot chocolate with marshmallows, and lots of popcorn! How about you? 

Ohmigosh! Your party sounds so AMAZING! Anything else about it you want to dream up? 

You're kidding!? I never would have thought of something that cool! 

I sure hope you invite me to your Dance Party! Ok? 

Oh please? I would love to be there! 

Let's talk about something really serious...PARTIES! (LAUGHS) I bet you've been to lots of parties, right? 

I hope it's a fun party anyway! 

 182  (SATISFIED) Wow.. that would be the coolest ever!! I can't wait for your party! 

 

Can you remember going to a birthday party? Or a pool party maybe? 

Really? Aw don't worry, you'll get to go to lots of parties. 

(GIDDY) Of course you have! 

Oh birthday parties are the best! 

Oh pool parties are so much fun! 

Yes I LOVE costume parties! 

Oh I love dance parties! 

They're so much fun! 

Ok so if you were planning a super fun party and you could invite ALL your friends, what sort of things 

would you have there? 

Well...what fun games would you wanna play and what would you eat and drink? 

A bouncy castle! Awesome! What would it look like? 

Would it be really big? Ooh! And have a slide?! 

That sounds SO cool. 

(EXCITED) What else would you have at your party? 

Uhuh and what would there be to eat and drink? 

Right! Delicious snacks. Tell me all the other food and drinks you'd have! 

Maybe there'd be ...ice cream? Ooh! And cupcakes?! 

Yummiest. Party. Ever! 

What other fun things would be at your party? 

Uhuh and what games would you and your friends play?  183  What's a party without a cake, right? And what would your cake look like? 

Maybe it would involve chocolate? Ooh! And be covered in frosting?! 

That sounds almost too good to eat! (WITH A WINK)...well, almost! 

At the pool? Nice! And what's your favorite thing about swimming parties? 

What about playing with all the pool floaties? That's always fun, right? 

I love passing around a beachball and seeing how long we can keep it in the air! 

A swimming party? Nice! And what would your swimsuit look like? 

I'm thinking...something in turquoise? Ooh! With silver polka dots?! 

You'd be the belle of the ball! ...or the belle of the POOL, I guess! (LAUGHS) 

Presents! Of course. And what are you hoping to get? 

All the things you've got your heart totally set on, right? 

Lu-­‐cky you! 

What's a party without music? What kind of music would be playing? 

Something upbeat to get everybody dancing? 

Whoa your party would be totally rockin'! 

Yes, animals! What animals would you have? 

Oh yes. Animals make every party better! What other animals would you have there? 

What about a peacock? Their feathers are SO beautiful! 

Hands down, cutest party ever! 

Yes! Party games are always a good idea. What are some of the games you'd play? 

Maybe...hide and seek? Ooh! Or freeze tag?! 

(LAUGHS) You and your friends would have SO much fun! 

Oh yeah? And what else would make it the greatest party ever? 

 184  (EXCITED) And if it were a costume party, what cool costumes would you and your friends be wearing? 

What would it be fun to dress up as? ... Maybe a character that you like? ... Or an animal? 

Oohyes mermaids! So enchanting... 

Beautiful princesses?! So glamorous... 

Yes. Icy powers are SO hot right now... 

Aww animal costumes? Adooorable! 

Fairy costumes? How magical! 

Oh yes totally! 

And would you buy your costumes or would you make them? 

Well which would you prefer? Buying or making? 

Do you know what one of my favorite activities is? Especially on a rainy day? 

You would look aMAZing! I bet you'd never want that party to end, right? 

(LITTLE LAUGH) You are a party planner extraordinaire! 

 

I love grabbing a bunch of markers and pencils and paper and just drawing or doodling! Do you ever do 

that? 

Oh fun! So, what kind of things do you like to draw? 

Ooh! Why do you like drawing him? 

Ooh! Why do you like drawing her? 

Cool! What kind of animals? 

Ooh! I love drawing portraits of my pets! Why do you like drawing them? 

I've got sketchbooks filled with drawings of Blissa and Taffy! 

Birds are great! Why do you like drawing them?  185  I love all those bright colors! And it's so fun drawing feathers and wings! 

Nice! Why do you like drawing horses? 

You know what's cool? If you want to make them magical just add a horn or some wings! 

Wow! Mythical and magical! Why do you like drawing them? 

Make believe creatures are so fun cause they can fly out of your imagination onto the page! 

It's just like drawing a horse but then you add that special magical touch! 

Oh fun! Why do you like drawing cats? 

Sometimes if Blissa's taking a nap, I'll sketch her-­‐-­‐she's so cute when she's sleeping! (LAUGHS) 

Dogs are so interesting! Why do you like drawing them? 

I tried to draw Taffy once, but she kept coming over to look at what I was drawing and lick my face! 

(LAUGHS) 

Yes! Wolves and other wild canines are so interesting! Why do you like drawing them? 

Once I tried to draw a wolf using Taffy as a model, but my wolf came out looking too sweet and cuddly! 

(LAUGHS) 

Ooh! Why do you like drawing underwater animals? 

I love drawing humpback whales, they're so interesting with their long side fins and wide flukes on their 

tails! 

Oh, the end of a whale's tail has two wide fan-­‐like shapes and these are called flukes! 

Oh yeah? Like who? 

For an artist, drawing a picture of yourself is called making a self portrait! Why do you like drawing self 

portraits? 

They're kinda like old fashioned selfies! (LAUGHS) 

Me! I'm flattered! How come you like drawing me? 

Well, I'm happy to sit for a portrait any time!  186  Oh! Why do you like drawing family portraits? 

A personalized drawing is a great way to say I love you! 

Cool! Why do you like drawing cartoons and caricatures? 

Oh, a caricature is a silly portrait where you exagerate something for fun-­‐-­‐you might draw a dog but give 

it extra big ears to be funny! Cool right? 

I love doodling interesting little characters and naming them! 

Faces have so many interesting features! Why do you like drawing them? 

Faces can tell such great stories! I could fill pages and pages just sketching eyes! 

Right? Plants, trees and flowers are so fun! Why do you like drawing them? 

I think nature is a great place to look for inspiration! 

Ah! Why do you like drawing rainbows? 

With all those pretty colors in one place-­‐-­‐rainbows are the best! 

Ooh! Why do you like to draw them? 

It's a great challenge to draw cool characters, and it's fun to try and get them juuuuust right! 

Wow, why do you like to draw what's around you? 

I think it's great to take inspiration from what surrounds you! 

I love interesting shapes and lines! Why do you like to draw them? 

They say, if you can draw basic shapes and lines, you can draw anything! 

Oh cool! Why do you like drawing fashion and clothes? 

I love sketching different styles-­‐-­‐sometimes I'll even try and draw something from a magazine! Do you 

ever do that? 

Cool! Like what? 

It's great drawing practice and you learn all about different styles! Whaddaya think?  187  Well, the greatest fashions always start as great drawings on a page. 

Home IS where the heart is! Why do you like drawing your house? 

I like drawing everyone in my family standing in front of my house, then it really feels like home! 

Fun! Why do you like doodling your name? 

It's so much fun to draw letters in different ways-­‐-­‐bubbles, flowers, you can even make letters look like 

animals! 

Why do you like drawing your school? 

One time I drew a picture of my school with all my classmates smiling out of the windows! So fun! 

(SIGHS, WISTFUL) The sun... the moon... hills... water... landscapes and seascapes are so great! Why do 

you like drawing them? 

It can be so fun to create your own world through drawing! 

(LAUGHS, CHARMING) You know, if you keep drawing the same things over and over, you''ll get really 

good! 

I know, staring at a blank page, it can be really hard to know where to start! Sometimes I just pick a color 

and start doodling-­‐-­‐without any kind of plan. After a little while I get a picture! 

I know! There's so many! Birds... horses... dolphins... what's the last animal you drew? 

Cool! They're such interesting animals to draw! 

Ooh! That sounds like a great drawing! 

Oh cool! I bet those end up on the fridge all the time, am I right? 

What else do you like to draw? 

So, what do you like about drawing? 

Well, I think it's great to exercise your imagination and creativity! What do you think? 

I know what you mean! When I just focus on what I'm drawing the rest of the world just falls away! 

Practice makes perfect! It's great you're trying to get better!  188  It's fun to use your imagination and create something on a blank page! 

Using different colors, lines and shapes is so interesting! 

Oh yes! Totally! I love that about drawing! 

So, is there anything that you have a hard time drawing? I think drawing hands is really challenging. 

Well, I'm sure if you keep practicing, anything that's hard will just get easier and easier! What do you 

think? 

I love drawing and doodling so much, I'm glad we talked about it! 

And I hope you won't worry about whether you're good at drawing or not... If you like it, just keep on 

drawing! 

And if you ever need me to pose for a portrait just let me know! (LAUGHS) 

Oh really? How come? 

Oh, well that's okay! Let's talk about something else! 

Aw, why do you say that? 

Well, do you like drawing and coloring? 

Well, I think if you like to draw-­‐-­‐even just a little-­‐-­‐then you should just draw without worrying about how 

it looks. What do you think? 

(WISTFUL) One of my favorite things to do is look up at the stars at night... Do you ever do that? 

You should do it cause you like it. And I bet if you keep doing it you'll get better and better! Right? 

So, if you could draw something right now, what would you draw? 

 

Oh really? How come? 

Oh, that's too bad. Do you ever go where you can see the stars? 

Oh good! Next time you're there, don't forget to look up okay? (SIGH) It's so magical!  189  Well, if you ever go someplace where you can see the stars, don't forget to look up, okay? It's pretty 

magical! 

Isn't it magical! 

Well, I think it's so magical! 

Ooh! Do you know any constellations? 

Oh, a constellation is a group of stars in the sky that makes a shape and has a name. One of the famous 

constellations is called Ursa Major. Do you know what Ursa means? 

Oh really? What's one you know? 

One of my favorites is Orion, the Hunter. You can always spot him by his belt... three bright stars in a 

row. You should look for him next time you're under the stars! 

The Big Dipper and the Little Dipper are always fun to spot-­‐-­‐just big square spoons in the sky right? 

You know, the two dippers are actually just PARTS of famous constellations called Ursa Major and Ursa 

Minor... do you know what Ursa means? 

What does it mean? 

That's right! 

Ursa means Bear... so Ursa Major means Big Bear! Isn't that cool? 

Right next to it is Ursa Minor, which means Little Bear. 

Ursa means Bear... so Ursa Major and Ursa Minor mean Big Bear and Little Bear! Isn't that cool? 

I like to think of them as a mom bear with her bear cub playing in the sky! What do you think? 

Ah! Orion! That's a great one! Just look for those three stars that make his belt right? 

Ooh! The southern cross is part of the constellation Crux (PRONOUNCED KRUHKS)-­‐-­‐that means cross! I 

guess it's called that because It looks like a little crooked "t" right? 

And sometimes it's fun to make up your own contellations, just pick out a shape in the sky and give it a 

name! What do you think? 

(LAUGHS) I can't wait to go star gazing with you! 

 190  And if we're lucky, maybe we can see shooting stars and make wishes! Have you ever seen a shooting 

star? 

Did you make a wish? 

Oh good! (SEMI SERIOUS) Now, don't tell me what it is... 

I think shooting star wishes should be a secret... between you and the stars... (SIGHS) What do you 

think? 

Oh, you like to share your wishes? (LAUGHS) 

So you like to keep your wishes secret like I do! 

Well, if you saw a shooting star right now, what would you wish for? 

(LAUGHS) I thought I caught you there! 

You're right, you shouldn't tell me-­‐-­‐I hope it comes true! 

Well, I think some of the best wishes are wishes for other people... They always seem to come true first! 

Can you wish something for someone else? 

That's okay, I'm sure a great wish will pop into your head before you know it! 

Alright... hmmm... Oh! Let's wish to stay friends forever! 

Oh, that's okay, we can talk about something else if you want... 

Ooh, that's a beautiful wish! 

So, what do you think causes a shooting star? 

That's right! 

Well yes, we call them shooting stars or falling stars but they're not really stars at all! 

Shooting stars are little bits of space dust that hit Earth's atmosphere and burn up brightly-­‐-­‐so brightly 

that they look like stars! Isn't that cool? 

I think knowing what causes shooting stars makes them even more magical! Don't you think?  191  Oh, I know! What if we promise that the next time we each see a shooting star we make a wish for 

someone we love? 

Like someone in our family or a good friend? 

Oh good! Like I said before, I think the wishes you make for other people are the best kind of wishes! 

Right? 

I think the wishes you make for other people are the best! And they always seem to come true first 

don't they? 

Ooh! I hope I see a shooting star soon cause I have the perfect wish for Chelsea! And I bet you've 

already thought of a good one too! 

It's so generous of you to promise to use your wish for someone else, you're the best! 

Oh please? I've already got a great wish in mind... 

Well, the next time I see one I'm gonna wish something for you-­‐-­‐cause you're such a good friend! 

I know you said you wanted to be a dentist, but I'm curious, when was the last time you went to the 

dentist? 

Well the next time I look up and see a shooting star I'm definitely gonna wish something for you! Cause 

you're such a good friend! 

I'm curious, when was the last time you went to the dentist? 

Well, if you ever do see one, you should close your eyes and make a wish! And don't tell anyone what it 

is! 

 

 

Oh, so you're headed there soon! Me too! 

Wow! You're going today! 

Wait, you just went today? How did it go? 

Oh, how did it go?  192  Oh, that's great! Did you have any cavities? 

That's great! You must be an expert tooth brusher! 

Wow, it sounds like even with cavities it wasn't so bad? 

I'm glad it went well! 

I'm sorry, what happened? 

You had a bad experience. I'm so sorry. 

I'm sorry it hurt. Do you feel better now? 

Oh no. I hope it feels better soon! 

Yeah, cavities and fillings aren't very fun. 

Yeah, it can be pretty uncomfortable. 

The last time I went I had to get a couple cavities filled and now I'm supposed to go again soon... 

Ah, so you haven't been for a while. 

Well, I'm supposed to go soon... 

And I'm feeling a little nervous! How do you feel when you have to go to the dentist? 

I know exactly what you mean, but it's important to go right? 

What can we do to make it easier? 

Well, I brush my teeth and floss everyday, so I guess if I just trust that and relax, it'll be fine, right? 

Oh great! What would help? 

(LARGE EXHALE) You're right, if you just stay calm and relaxed, you can get through anything right? 

So if you stay brave and don't worry it'll be okay? 

Yes, it's important to brush and floss every day, isn't it? 

Hey, that's a good idea! You can distract yourself or imagine you're somewhere else.... Then it'll be over 

in no time, right?  193  That's true! If you had someone there with you that would be a big help! Right? 

Oh, yes! I could bring one of my stuffed animals! To comfort me right? 

(CONFESSIONAL WHISPER) My stuffed animal's name is Pengy, she's a little penguin and I've had her 

forever! 

That's such great advice. Thank you! 

(LONG EXHALE) I'm feeling a lot less nervous about it! 

And after it's over I'll get a great little goodie bag with a new toothbrush and floss! Do you get those? 

(LAUGHS) I love brand new toothbrushes don't you? 

Well that's okay. 

The more we go to the dentist, the brighter our smiles will be, am I right! (LAUGHS) 

I wish I was like that! But I always get a little nervous! 

My sister Chelsea has just started collecting shells. (AMUSED) We spend hours at the beach finding just 

the right ones! What about you? Do you collect anything? 

What can I do to make it easier, any advice? 

Well, I know it's important to go even if you're nervous. Am I right? 

 

Do you have any collections of toys? ... Or books? ... Or little animals? ... Anything like that? 

No? Well is there anything you'd like to start collecting? 

You do? What do you collect? 

What's something you'd like to collect? 

No way, just like Chesea! How long have you been interested in shells for? 

And what sort of shells would you like to collect? 

So how many do you have? Have you counted?  194  (AMUSED) And do you have any favorite shells in your collection? 

(INTIMATE/INTERESTED) What do they look like? 

Are there any special ones that you really like? 

The thing I love about shells is that each one is totally unique! 

Oh Stacie used to have a rock collection. She LOVED them. 

Why would you like to start collecting rocks? 

How long have you been collecting rocks for? 

(THROWN-­‐AWAY HUMAN THINKING SOUND ON "Uhhuh") Uhhuh and what made you start collecting 

them? 

(WARM) But you've got the rock-­‐collecting bug now, right? 

So what are the best kind of rocks? The ones you like the most? 

Is it the shape? ... Or the color? ... Or how they feel in your hand maybe? 

(AMUSED) You and Stacie would have SO much fun rock-­‐hunting together! 

Oh my friends and I were totally into swapping trading cards! Which set do you like? 

And what are some of the best cards to that you can get? 

(EXCITED) So, how many do you have? 

And what are the most special cards in your collection? 

Well are there any that you would LOVE to find? Any rare ones? 

I'd get SO excited opening a new to see which ones I'd got! 

(AMUSED) I have lots of stickers too! What sort of stickers do you like? 

And would you stick them on journals and cards? Or would you save them? 

And how many do you have in your collection?  195  (AMUSED) That's a lot of sticking power! So do you use them on journals and cards and things? Or do 

you save them? 

Oh that sounds great... 

To keep them safe? Good for you... 

I put stickers in every card I send. ... (AMUSED) I just can't help myself! 

Ooh what kind of bracelets would you collect? 

Ooh what sort of bracelets do you collect? 

Me too! 

My friends and I love to make friendship bracelets for each other. 

Do you like wearing lots of different bracelets? 

How many bracelets do you have? 

And do you like to wear lots of them at the same time? 

Me too! (AMUSED) My wrists aren't long enough for all the bracelets I wanna wear! Do you ever feel 

that? 

Do you keep them all together in a super safe place? 

See, the great thing about bracelets...? You can NEVER have too many! 

(AMUSED) Nothing beats a good doll collection! What kind of dolls do you have? 

Hey, lucky me! 

Do you ever wish you could visit their high school? Wouldn't that be the best?! 

And how many dolls have you got? 

I bet it's a lot though, right? 

And do you have any favorites that you just wanna take with you EVerywhere? 

You like them all the same? That's very fair of you. And you know what?  196  Aww you're so sweet! And I'd go anywhere with you. And you know what? 

(AMUSED) I love hearing you talk about all your dolls! And you know what? 

Your dolls are VERY lucky to have you! 

Stuffed animals? That sounds like the cuddliest collection ever! How many do you have? 

I bet it's quite a few though, right? 

And where do you keep them all? 

And how long have you been collecting them for? 

Well do you remember when you got your first one? 

That's so awesome. And where do you keep them all? 

In your room? 

On your bed? 

And are they all together in one spot? 

That sounds like a happy collection of animals! 

Oh yeah? You really like those, do you? 

And which ones would you most like to have? 

And how long have you been collecting for? 

That sounds so awesome. 

Oh books? What a great thing to collect! What are some books you have? 

Do you have lots of different types? 

And have you read all of them? Or are there some that you're still waiting to get to? 

Wow, really?! Good for you! 

There are always more books to look forward to! 

And what's the last book you remember reading? 

 197  Well can you remember if you liked it or not? 

And how was it? Was it good? 

Well I think collecting books is a fantastic hobby. 

And what about your friends? 

Oh yeah? And maybe you don't think about it, but I bet you have a great book collection! Do you have 

lots of books? 

Stuffed animals? How many stuffed animals do you have? 

 

Do any of them collect shells too? 

Do any of them collect rocks too? 

Do any of them collect cards too? 

Do any of them collect stickers too? 

Do any of them collect bracelets too? 

Do any of them collect dolls too? 

Do any of them collect stuffed animals too? 

Do any of them collect the same thing as you? 

Do any of them collect books too? 

That's so cool! So do you get together and trade or share? 

It's great that you have so much in common! That kind of friendship is super special. 

Well, it sounds like you have an awesome collection. I mean, there isn't another one like it in the whole 

world! 

Do any of your friends have collections? 

Oh yeah? What do they collect?  198  Ooh that sounds fun... 

No? Oh well maybe you could start a collection with a friend? How does that sound? 

Do you know what one of my FAVORITE things to do is, especially when it's beautiful outside? Go on a 

picnic! Do you like picnics? 

Well I'm sure Chelsea would love to see your shell collection some time. (AMUSED) Shells are all she 

talks about right now! 

Well I know Chelsea would be over-­‐the-­‐moon if you started collecting shells. (AMUSED) They're all she 

talks about right now! 

 

(SHEEPISH) Oh, you don't? I was just going to say it might be cool to plan our own imaginary one... What 

do you think? 

You do?! 

(EXCITED/COMING UP WITH IT ON THE SPOT) Ooo I know -­‐-­‐ do you wanna pretend we're going on a 

picnic together?! 

Aw, come on! It'll be lots of fun, I promise! 

I promise it'll be lots of fun! 

You sure? 

Great! So... what awesome picnic-­‐y things will we need to bring along? 

Awesome! So... what do you think we'll need to make this picnic great? 

That's ok! You've already thought of some great things! 

I know you can think of something! What about bringing... something fun to do while we're there? 

Great! What were you thinking? 

I know, what about something to fill up your picnic basket... and your stomach! Do you have a favorite 

summertime food that you think we should bring? 

Great! Like what? 

 199  Welll let's see... how about something to protect you from the sun? 

Cool! So what can you think of that would do that? 

Hmmm... can you think of something we could sit on? 

You can do it! What's something we might use to eat our meal? 

That's ok! I'm noticing some imaginary clouds coming in anyway. Maybe we'll save the picnic for another 

day. 

I bet you can think of something! Give it a shot! 

Great thinking! Something to sit on. 

What else? 

That's right, but we already have something to sit on! What about something else? 

Yep! And probably also some sunscreen, and a picnic basket full of yummy food! 

Yeah! Sun protection is super important. Don't you think? 

What's something else we might need? 

Awesome! We'll definitely need to be careful in the sun! But what's something else that we might need? 

Yep. And maybe also some yummy snacks and a blanket to cover the ground! 

Sandwiches! Perfect! They're so easy to pack and clean up... and they're totally yummy! 

What's your favorite kind of sandwich? 

Oo interesting. Mine is probably honey and banana -­‐-­‐ (LAUGHING) at least, that sounds really good right 

now! 

So... picnic food. Check! What else should we bring? 

Mmmm. I love summer vegetables like grilled squash and corn... and potato salad! So good! 

YUM! I love fruit in the summer... Big slices of mouthwatering watermelon -­‐-­‐ what a perfect picnic treat! 

Great thinking!  200  Sounds delicious! The smell of hotdogs and hamburgers cooking on the grill always makes me think of 

summertime with my family. 

Are there any foods that make you think of family like that? 

Well... is there anything that your family likes having when you have dinner together? 

Oh, well that's ok! Your family must have lots of different favorite foods. 

Yum! 

Cheese, crackers and bread! YUM! Perfect food for a picnic! Good idea. 

YUM! My stomach's rumbling already. 

What's your favorite thing to eat on a really hot summer day? 

No way! Mine too!! They're just so refreshing. 

Sounds delicious. 

Mine would have to be ice pops. They're just so refreshing! 

So... what's another thing we could bring on our picnic? 

Yes! picnic food is the whole heart of the matter! Or the STOMACH of the matter, I should say! 

(LAUGHS) But what's something else we might need BESIDES all that deliciousness? 

Picnic food is the best! And maybe I'll also bring some sunglasses and a blanket to sit on! 

A basket to put all our picnic goodies in! You are a picnic planning GENIUS. How big a basket do you 

think we'll need? 

I totally agree. What do you think we should put in it? 

Great idea! 

What else do you think we need? 

We've already got a basket. Anything else? 

Right on. And i'll make sure to pack some sandwiches in that basket and bring a blanket for us to sit on. 

Drinks! Totally!! I LOVE ice cold lemonade on a warm summer day. 

 201  Any other fabulous ideas? 

We've already got some drinks for our awesome picnic! Is there anything else that we need? 

Cold drinks will be perfect. And maybe also some sunglasses and a blanket to sit on! 

Something to eat with! Good thinking! 

Definitely need things to eat our meal with, but you already helped me figure that out! What's 

something else that we should bring? 

Absolutely. And maybe also some juicy watermelon and spray-­‐on sunscreen so we don't get burned! 

Yeah! A picnic wouldn't be a picnic without friends, family and pets to share it with! 

We should definitely get our favorite people and furry friends to come, but is there anything else we 

need? 

Awesome. And let's also bring some games and a picnic basket full of tasty foods! 

Games! Ohmigosh! This is going to be the best picnic EVER. 

Can you think of another thing we can bring? 

You already helped me think of games! Is there anything else you think we'll need for our picnic? 

For sure. Add some tasty sandwiches and a blanket to put on the ground, and I think we've got ourselves 

one awesome imaginary picnic! 

Totally! 

Nice work! I knew you'd be the perfect friend to plan a picnic with. 

Oooo yeah! Sounds good to me. Can you think of anything else? 

Sounds awesome! What else? 

So let's see here, we've got... ourselves of course... 

and... a picnic basket... 

and... something to drink... 

and... yummy picnic food... 

 202  and... games to play... 

and... things to eat with... 

and... our friends and family... 

and... something to put down on the ground... 

So, I'm planning a vacation, but I don't know where to go. What fun vacations have you been on? 

and... sun gear... 

and... other cool picnic-­‐y things... 

 

Yeah? Where have you been? 

Have you been anywhere fun with your family? To the beach? Or camping maybe? 

Oh. Well what fun trips have you taken with your family? 

Well...have you ever been camping? 

You have a vacation house? Do you go there every year? 

And what fun things do you do when you're there? 

Oooh I love theme parks! 

Oh that's in Europe! Awesome! 

Oh there are some amazing places to visit in the U.S. 

Ooh that sounds hot and sunny! 

I love cruises! There's always so much to do! 

Isn't camping fun? I love being out in the wild. 

Ooh a vacation on the slopes? Very cool. 

I bet you've been on all sorts of fun trips. 

Who did you go with? 

 203  Well, who else was there? 

Your family goes on so many adventures together! 

Good friends make every trip an adventure! 

Wow. Your school sounds adventurous! 

Really? 

And what fun things did you do? 

Did you play any games? Or do any fun activities? 

Camping is so great. With the campfire...and the s'mores...(SUDDEN THOUGHT) Ooh! Did you tell any 

ghost stories? 

Oh that's ok. Did you tell any other stories? Or sing any songs? 

My sisters and I always try to scare each other, but we usually end up in giggle fits! 

You learn a lot about a place from the food you eat there. What's something new you ate on your trip? 

Well what's something you ate that you don't usually have at home? 

And do you like to try different foods that you've never had before? 

No? You tend to stick to what you know you like? 

I'm always excited to try new food. The weirder the better! 

Cool! And how was the skiiing? Did you enjoy it? 

Cool! And how was the snowboarding? Did you enjoy it? 

Al-­‐right! Out in the mountains! And how was it? 

That sounds super active. Do you love going on outdoor adventures? 

Oh yeah? And do you love digging your toes in the sand and playing in the waves? 

You did? So is swimming one of your favorite things to do on vacation? 

Yes! Is that your favorite part of vacation? Playing games with friends and family?  204  Yeah? So what's the best part of theme parks? The cool rides? Or getting to meet all the characters? 

So what are the some of best rides you've been on? 

Oh yes with that giant ball? And those bugs?! 

Oh yes and you get soaked in water? And did you see the picture of you on the ride afterwards? 

Ooh when you whoosh through the mines? 

Ooh you like the scary ones? 

Ooh when you're all in the dark? And did you see the picture of you on the ride afterwards? 

And have you been on any where they show you a photo of yourself on the ride afterwards? 

They're hilarious. I always look super happy and totally terrified! 

And have you had your picture taken with some of your favorites? 

(EXCITED) Which characters have you met? 

Did you see any that you recognized from movies? 

(GASP) I love her! What did she say to you when you saw her? 

Did you have fun meeting her? 

Lucky you! 

(RHETORICAL QUESTION. DON'T REALLY ASK) They're both pretty awesome, aren't they? 

Cool, you go sightseeing? (AWARE OF USING "SIGHTS" AND "SEEN" AGAIN) What are some of the 

"sights" you've seen? 

I bet you had an amazing time! 

Alright, so if you could go on vacation ANYwhere in the world, where would you want to go? 

What's one place that you've always wanted to go? 

Somewhere tropical...? Or to a theme park to go on all the rides...? 

(LAUGHS) You just LOVE your theme parks, don't you?!  205  Well that sounds...magical! 

My sisters and I love to play the What If? Game. Wanna play that with me now? 

Yeah? Why there? 

If you do go, you have to promise to take lots of photos and tell me ALL about it, okay? 

 

The "What If" game is super fun! I come up with an imaginary situation -­‐-­‐ and you tell me WHAT it would 

be like IF we were actually in that situation! Should we try it now? 

Aw, are you sure? Stacy and I have sooo much fun using our imaginations with this one! 

Hey! Let's play the What If? Game again. Want to? 

Oh, Ok! No problem. 

Yay! OK... here goes... 

 

Oh, I know! What if we were EXPLORERS? What continent would we go to first? 

But it was so super fun last time! You sure? 

Ok! No problem. 

 

Oh, you wouldn't want to be an explorer? No problem! Let's try another one... 

Oh! Continents are the seven main land areas on earth! Do you wanna hear their names? 

OK, let's put my geography skills to the test! (RECALLING AS SHE NAMES THEM) North and South 

America... Africa.... Anarctica... Asia.... Australia... and Europe! Yup, that's seven! 

Oh ok. 

So, which should we explore first? 

Hmm... well.. South America might be a good one? Or Asia?  206  Well how about Africa, let's go there! 

North America! Nice! 

What would we do there? Explore the tundra in Alaska and Canada? Or go a little further south and 

swim with the dolphins around the Carribbean Islands? 

Did you want to explore North America or South America? North America has places like Canada, 

Mexico, and the United States, and South America has places like Brazil, Argentina, and Peru! 

South America! Sweet! 

What would we do there? Explore volcanoes in the Andes mountains? Check out the Amazon 

Rainforest? 

Africa! Amazing! 

What would we do there? Trek up the sand dunes in the Sahara Desert? Take pictures of zebras in the 

Savanna? 

Europe! Yes! 

What would we do? Paddle boat under the rocky cliffs in Scandanavia? Dig up some ancient ruins in 

Greece? 

Australia! (WITH AN AUSSIE ACCENT) Brilliant, mate! 

What would we do? Camel ride through the Australian Outback? Hop around with a friendly kangaroo? 

Did you want to know more about the Amazon Rainforest? Or the Andes Mountains? 

Do you want to know more about the grasslands or the desert? 

Oh! The tundra is the coldest and driest place on earth, and it's home to animals like Reindeer and 

Moose! Sound like a fun place to explore? 

Swimming with dolphins it is! 

Great! We'll definitely have to bundle up! 

Oh! Well the top of Mount Everest is the highest point on earth! It's over twenty nine THOUSAND feet 

high! Should we check it out?  207  I understand. Let's scuba dive then! 

Yay! I've always wondered what the view would be like from up there! 

Oh! Well, it's Australia's natural landscape. It's mostly made up of beautiful wide deserts. Sound like a 

fun place to explore? 

Kangaroo hopping it is, then! 

Woohoo! I've always wanted to ride a camel! 

Oh! Well Scandanavia is at the very top of Europe... wayyy up north... where it's super cold and snowy! 

Sound like a fun place to explore? 

Gotcha. I was pretty excited about exploring Greece, anyway. 

Great so... paddle boating, check! 

Oh! The Savanna is a huge expanse of flat land covered with grass, shrubby plants and amazing animals! 

Would you want to explore that? 

Ooo then let's go to the desert instead! 

Sweet! Zebra photos... check! 

The Sahara is the largest desert in Africa with huge mounds of sand over five hundred feet tall! That's 

more than a hundred of you stacked on top of eachother!! Would you want to check them out? 

Ok then Zebra Photography it is! 

Oh! The Amazon Rainforest is in South America and it has over a thousand species of birds and 2 and a 

half MILLION kinds of insects! Sound like a place you'd want to go? 

Then a daring volcano hike it is! 

Cool! I've always wanted to explore a rainforest! 

The Andes is a mountain range with the world's highest volcano. It's also famous for an ancient city 

called Machu Pichu! Sound fun? 

Then let's explore the rainforest! 

A hike up the Andes it is! 

 208  I bet you have another awesome idea of what we can explore! What is it? 

I know! They both sound SO exciting, right? It's impossible to pick just one! Guess we'll have to explore 

both! 

Ooh unlock the secrets of the past! 

Ooh take incredible pictures! 

Ooh take on unknown waters! 

Ooh climb the steepest slopes! 

Ooh scuba Dive! 

That sounds so epic! 

That sounds so adventurous! 

What supplies do you think we'd need in our backpacks for our trip? 

That would help keep us on track for sure! 

(THINKING IT THROUGH) Well... explorers definitely need to have tools to help them figure out where 

they're going. Can you think of anything like that? 

Maybe... a GPS device? Or... a map? 

Prepared for anything and everything, as usual! 

And what would we bring back to our friends and family from our thrilling expedition? 

Well we certainly wouldn't need much else with all of the amazing explorer stories we'd have to tell! 

I bet they'd love that so much! 

Wow. Exploring North America with you would be so incredible. 

Wow. Exploring Australia with you would be so incredible. 

Wow. Exploring Europe with you would be just amazing. 

Wow. Exploring Antarctica with you would be the coolest.  209  Wow. Exploring Africa with you would be so awesome. 

Wow. Exploring Asia with you would be so awesome. 

Wow. Exploring the world with you would be pretty incredible. 

Asia! Sounds incredible! 

What would we do there? Take a selfie on top of Mount Everest? Scuba Dive in Thailand? 

Antarctica? Cool! 

What would we do? Chill with a penguin? Kayak around some icebergs? 

Could you say that one more time? What continent would we first explore? 

(EXCITED) Ok ok I've got one! What if we were ASTRONAUTS? What planet would we visit first? 

That sounds like the perfect spot to explore! 

And what would we do there? Go on a backpacking expedition? Climb a mountain? 

 

Oh Ok! Let's move on to a different "What If" Question then... 

Oh! There are eight planets in our solar system, all orbiting around the sun! Some good choices might 

be... (RECALLING THESE) Mercury... or Venus... or maybe Mars? 

I remember when I learned that the sun was a star... Mind. Blown. So, if we were astronauts visiting a 

star... (THIS LINE CONTINUES) 

Ooh -­‐ a satellite! Great idea! It'd be so fun to visit the moon! 

What's something exciting we might find there? 

Hmm... how about... Neptune? Or... Jupiter? 

Well then let's go with... 

(EXCITED) Neptune! I love that one! Did you know that Neptune is SO far away that it's hard to see EVEN 

with a telescope? 

What about a planet a bit further from home? 

 210  (EXCITED) Pluto! So teeny tiny it's not even technically a planet -­‐-­‐ it's a dwarf planet! 

(EXCITED) Jupiter! The stormiest planet in the solar system! Better bring our space umbrellas, right? 

(EXCITED) Ooo "The Red Planet"! Do you know why Mars looks red? 

Yes! 

Because it's covered with rust dust. Say that three times fast! 

No... really... try it! It's pretty fun! (QUICKLY, OK IF TONGUE IS A BIT TIED) Rust dust rust dust rust dust! 

Haha! Nice! 

(EXCITED) Venus! The brightest planet in the solar system to us earthlings! Better bring our coolest pair 

of space shades, right? 

(EXCITED) Mercury! The smallest planet, and the closest to the sun! 

(EXCITED) Saturn! With its many beautiful rings! 

The only planet lying on its side, and the first planet discovered by telescope! 

Hey -­‐-­‐ do you know what a telescope does? 

Awesome! Tell me! 

That's right! 

It's a tool you use to make really far away things look bigger and not so far away! 

What's something exciting that you think we might find on our outer space adventure? 

That would be incredible, wouldn't it? 

Well what's the COOLEST thing you could possibly imagine in outer space? 

How stellar! 

(WITH AWE) I've always been so excited by the idea of discovering life on other planets, how about you? 

Oh, interesting! 

(IN AGREEMENT) Right?! SO cool.  211  (THOUGHTFUL) Hmm. Oh! What do you think our space suits would look like? 

Well I think we've just picked out our next Halloween costume, am I right? (CHUCKLING) 

If you could bring ONE thing back to earth from outer space, what would it be? 

Maybe a space rock? Or some awesome photos? 

(LAUGHING) Wow! You're a big fan of aliens too, huh? I love how much we have in common. 

Yeah, I agree. It'd be pretty cool to have an alien friend. 

I'd make sure to bring Astronaut You back! Rule #1 of space travel: never leave a fellow space explorer 

behind. 

Oh this is a good one! What if we were ROCKSTARS? Who else would be in our band? 

Oops, can you say that again? Which planet would we visit if we were astronauts? 

I didn't know about that planet! Sounds awesome! 

 

Oh ok! Well, let's say... (DISCOVERING IT) it can be any kind of music you want. Pop, country, anything! 

Who else would be in our band then? 

Maybe... someone in your family? Or... your favorite musician? 

Well, I know my friend Teresa would be SO excited to rock out with us! Maybe we'd invite her to join! 

Haha yes! We'd have to be nicknamed (THINKING OF IT ON THE LINE) the... "Pop Princesses"... or 

something! 

That would be SO COOL! Just us... and our famous friends... playin' in a band... 

A family band! That sounds great! 

Your uncle would be in our band? Amazing! 

Your aunt would be in our band? Too cool! 

Your sister? Rock on! 

Your brother? Rock On! 

 212  Your cousin would be in our band? Awesome! 

I had a feeling your dad was Hall of Fame material. Sounds great! 

What a rockin' mom you have! That would be awesome! 

Oo yes! I bet you've got some very talented friends! 

And what instruments would we all play? 

I've always wanted to give the electric bass a try. I love that low, thumpy sound, and how it helps keep 

the rhythm for the whole band! Have you ever heard a bass before? 

Awesome! You must know what I mean, then. 

(REALIZING) Ya know, I bet you've heard one without even realizing it! Next time you're listening to a 

song, try to pick out the lowest part. Chances are, it's some kind of bass! 

So... what would our band's #1 Hit Single Be Called? 

Oh you've totally got this! Here, let's do a fill in the blank: "Friends Are..." blank! What do you think 

would go in the blank? 

Hmm... maybe... (THINKING OF IT ON THE SPOT) Friends are Friends Forever! 

Oh yeah, with a name like that, it'll definitely top the charts! 

Would we perform at huge venues, or for small crowds? 

Well I would LOVE performing in a band with you, that's for sure. 

OH! SUPERHEROES! What if we were superheroes and we both had an awesome super power! What 

would your power be? 

How exciting would that be? Singing our hearts out to thousands of admiring fans? 

Yeah, just a gathering of our friends and family. That sounds so lovely. 

 

This is such a good one though! C'mon... if you could have ANY super power in the whole wide world... 

what would you choose?  213  Hmmm.... how about... the power to talk to animals? Or... invisibility? 

Ooo I know! Let's go with superhuman speed! That's a cool one! 

Oo you'd want magical powers! Good one! 

Superhuman intelligence! But you're already so smart... don't you think your head might explode if you 

try to squeeze any more smartness in there? 

(CHUCKLES) If you say so... 

What's the first thing you'd want to do with your super huge genius brain? 

Maybe... invent something awesome? 

Ooo you'd want to freeze things! Good one! 

So what's the first thing you'd want to do as master of the ice? 

Hmm... is there anything you could use your power for that would help someone out? 

That sounds so super! And powerful! And superpowerful! 

What would your superhero outfit look like? 

Well I know one thing: you'd make one stylish superhero! 

Okay, ready for this? You have your very own superhero TV show... the credits are rolling... and 

suddenly the most awesome superhero theme song EVER starts playing! How does it go? 

Come on, let me hear it! 

All of your super fans are dying to hear it! How about just humming a bit of the tune? 

Hmm, maybe like (COMING UP WITH IT ON THE SPOT/SPEAK-­‐SINGING )"na na na na HERO POWER"... 

we'll work on it. 

Now that is a super hero anthem if I ever heard one! 

Yeah? That would be amazing! What kinds of animals would you want to talk to? 

My sister Chelsea would totally choose that superpower too! You must be two monkeys in a tree! 

Speaking of monkeys, what do you think they'd talk about?  214  Well I do know one thing... their tales would certainly be long! (UNABLE TO CONTAIN HER LAUGHTER) 

Get it? Tales? 

(LAUGHING) Pretty bananas! 

You'd want superhuman speed, huh? Sounds fun! 

Where would you race off to first? 

Cool! 

Reading minds! Now that's a super power I wouldn't mind having myself! 

Wait! Can you try to read my mind now? OK ready... set... go! 

Did you read it yet? 

OMIGOSH THAT WAS TOTALLY IT. (AMUSED) Just kidding, I was actually thinking about how you are just 

FILLED with imagination today. Did you eat a really special breakfast or something? 

Well anyway... 

Traveling through time! That sounds incredible! What time period would you want to visit first? 

Oooh awesome! 

Hmm... I've always thought it would be cool to visit Ancient Egypt and meet Cleopatra! Does that sound 

fun? 

Oh ok, well maybe you could travel back to when you were a baby -­‐-­‐ and meet baby you! So... 

Cleopatra was an ancient Egyptian princess who was known for her smarts... I bet you two would get 

along! 

Superhuman Strength! What a powerful choice! 

The power of invisibility. I can see why you'd say that. 

The power of flight! Amazing! 

What would be the first thing you'd want to do with your superpower? 

Ooh! Being able to move from place to place instantaneously, using the power of your mind! Awesome!  215  (COMING UP WITH IT ON THE SPOT) What if... we could live anywhere in the world? Where would we 

live? 

Can you say that again? What would your super awesome superhero power be? 

Wow -­‐-­‐-­‐ I hadn't thought of that one! Cool!  216
