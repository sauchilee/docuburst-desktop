==========/NN 
This/DT book/NN is/VBZ not/RB intended/VBN to/TO prepare/VB for/IN college/NN entrance/NN

stock/JJ examinations/NNS in/IN physics,/NN chemistry,/NN or/CC hygiene,/NN but/CC it/PRP should/MD 
prepare/VB the/DT thoughtful/JJ reader/NN to/TO meet/VB wisely/RB and/CC actively/RB some/DT of/IN 
life's/NNS important/JJ problems,/NN and/CC should/MD enable/VB him/PRP to/TO pass/VB muster/NN on/IN the/DT 
principles/NNS and/CC theories/NNS underlying/VBG scientific,/NN and/CC therefore/RB economic,/VBP 
management,/NN whether/IN in/IN the/DT shop/NN or/CC in/IN the/DT home./NN 
We/PRP hear/VBP a/DT great/JJ deal/NN about/IN the/DT conservation/NN of/IN our/PRP$ natural/JJ resources,/NN 
such/JJ as/IN forests/NNS and/CC waterways;/NN it/PRP is/VBZ hoped/VBN that/IN this/DT book/NN will/MD show/VB 
the/DT vital/JJ importance/NN of/IN the/DT conservation/NN of/IN human/JJ strength/NN and/CC health,/NN 
and/CC the/DT irreparable/JJ loss/NN to/TO society/NN of/IN energy/NN uselessly/RB dissipated,/VBP 
either/DT in/NN idle/JJ worry/NN or/CC in/IN aimless/JJ activity./JJ Most/JJS of/IN us/PRP would/MD reproach/NN 
ourselves/PRP for/IN lack/NN of/IN shrewdness/NN if/IN we/PRP spent/VBD for/IN any/DT article/NN more/JJR than/IN 
it/PRP was/VBD worth,/VBG yet/RB few/NN of/IN us/PRP consider/VBP that/IN we/PRP daily/JJ expend/VB on/IN domestic/JJ 
and/CC business/NN tasks/NNS an/DT amount/NN of/IN energy/NN far/RB in/IN excess/NN of/IN that/DT actually/RB 
required./VBN The/DT farmer/NN who/WP flails/VBZ his/PRP$ grain/NN instead/RB of/IN threshing/NN it/PRP 
wastes/NNS time/NN and/CC energy;/VBG the/DT housewife/NN who/WP washes/VBZ with/IN her/PRP$ hands/NNS alone/RB 
and/CC does/VBZ not/RB aid/VB herself/PRP by/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN washing/VBG machine/NN and/CC proper/JJ 
bleaching/VBG agents/NNS dissipates/VBZ energy/NN sadly/RB needed/VBD for/IN other/JJ duties./JJ 
The/DT Chapter/NN on/IN machines/NNS is/VBZ intended/VBN not/RB only/RB as/IN a/DT stimulus/NN to/TO the/DT 
invention/NN of/IN further/JJ labor-saving/JJ devices,/NN but/CC also/RB as/IN an/DT eye/NN opener/NN 
to/TO those/DT who,/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN struggle/NN for/IN existence,/NN must/MD perforce/RB go/VB 
to/TO the/DT wall/NN unless/IN they/PRP understand/VBP how/WRB to/TO make/VB use/NN of/IN contrivances/NNS 
whereby/WRB man's/NNS limited/JJ physical/JJ strength/NN is/VBZ made/VBN effective/JJ for/IN larger/JJR 
tasks./JJ 
==========/NN 
The/DT Chapter/NN on/IN musical/JJ instruments/NNS is/VBZ more/RBR detailed/VBN than/IN seems/VBZ 
warranted/VBN at/IN first/JJ sight;/NN but/CC interest/NN in/IN orchestral/JJ instruments/NNS is/VBZ 
real/NN and/CC general,/NN and/CC there/EX is/VBZ a/DT persistent/JJ desire/NN for/IN intelligent/JJ 
information/NN relative/JJ to/TO musical/JJ instruments./VBD The/DT child/NN of/IN the/DT laborer/NN 
as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT child/NN of/IN the/DT merchant/NN finds/VBZ it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO attend/VB some/DT 
of/IN the/DT weekly/JJ orchestral/JJ concerts,/NN with/IN their/PRP$ tiers/NNS of/IN cheap/JJ seats,/NN 
and/CC nothing/NN adds/VBZ more/JJR to/TO the/DT enjoyment/NN and/CC instruction/NN of/IN such/JJ hours/NNS 
than/IN an/DT intimate/JJ acquaintance/NN with/IN the/DT leading/VBG instruments./JJ Unless/IN 
this/DT is/VBZ given/VBN in/IN the/DT public/JJ schools,/VBG a/DT large/JJ percentage/NN of/IN mankind/NN is/VBZ 
deprived/VBN of/IN it,/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ for/IN this/DT reason/NN that/IN so/RB large/JJ a/DT share/NN of/IN the/DT 
treatment/NN of/IN sound/NN has/VBZ been/VBN devoted/VBN to/TO musical/JJ instruments./JJ 
The/DT treatment/NN of/IN electricity/NN is/VBZ more/RBR theoretical/JJ than/IN that/DT used/VBD in/IN 
preceding/VBG Chapters,/NNP but/CC the/DT subject/NN does/VBZ not/RB lend/VB itself/PRP readily/RB to/TO 
popular/JJ presentation;/NN and,/NN moreover,/NN it/PRP is/VBZ assumed/VBN that/DT the/DT 
information/NN and/CC training/NN acquired/VBN in/IN the/DT previous/JJ work/NN will/MD give/VB the/DT 
pupil/NN power/NN to/TO understand/VB the/DT more/RBR advanced/VBD thought/VBN and/CC method./JJ 
The/DT real/JJ value/NN of/IN a/DT book/NN depends/VBZ not/RB so/RB much/JJ upon/IN the/DT information/NN 
given/VBN as/IN upon/IN the/DT permanent/JJ interest/NN stimulated/VBN and/CC the/DT initiative/NN 
aroused./VBD The/DT youthful/JJ mind,/NN and/CC indeed/RB the/DT average/JJ adult/NN mind/NN as/IN 
well,/NN is/VBZ singularly/RB non-logical/VBG and/CC incapable/NN of/IN continued/VBN 
concentration,/NN and/CC loses/VBZ interest/NN under/IN too/RB consecutive/JJ thought/VBD and/CC 
sustained/VBN style./JJ For/IN this/DT reason/NN the/DT author/NN has/VBZ sacrificed/VBN at/IN times/NNS 
detail/NN to/TO general/JJ effect,/NN logical/JJ development/NN to/TO present-day/JJ interest/NN 
and/CC facts,/NN and/CC has/VBZ made/VBN use/NN of/IN a/DT popular,/NN light/NN style/NN of/IN writing/VBG as/IN 
well/RB as/IN of/IN the/DT more/RBR formal/JJ and/CC logical/JJ style/NN common/JJ to/TO books/NNS of/IN 
science./CD 
No/DT claim/NN is/VBZ made/VBN to/TO originality/NN in/IN subject/NN matter./VBD The/DT actual/JJ facts,/NN 
theories,/NN and/CC principles/NNS used/VBN are/VBP such/JJ as/IN have/VBP been/VBN presented/VBN in/IN 
previous/JJ textbooks/NNS of/IN science,/NN but/CC the/DT manner/NN and/CC sequence/NN of/IN

mental/JJ training/NN sacrificed/VBN to/TO information;/VB but/CC mental/JJ development/NN is/VBZ

the/DT actual/JJ daily/JJ happenings/NNS of/IN the/DT home/NN and/CC the/DT shop/NN and/CC the/DT field,/NN

2./CD General/NNP Effect/NN of/IN Heat./NNP _Expansion/NN and/CC Contraction_./NNP One/CD of/IN the/DT

to/TO the/DT different/JJ ways/NNS in/IN which/WDT their/PRP$ tones/NNS are/VBP produced:--/JJ 
==========/NN 
_First._/VBD The/DT stringed/JJ instruments/NNS in/IN which/WDT sound/VBP is/VBZ produced/VBN by/IN the/DT 
vibration/NN of/IN stretched/VBN strings,/NN as/IN in/IN the/DT piano,/NN violin,/NN guitar,/NN

_Second._/VBD The/DT wind/NN instruments/NNS in/IN which/WDT sound/VBP is/VBZ produced/VBN by/IN the/DT 
vibrations/NNS of/IN definite/JJ columns/NNS of/IN air,/NN as/IN in/IN the/DT organ,/NN flute,/NN cornet,/NN

_Third._/VBD The/DT percussion/NN instruments,/NN in/IN which/WDT sound/VBP is/VBZ produced/VBN by/IN the/DT 
motion/NN of/IN stretched/VBN membranes,/NN as/IN in/IN the/DT drum,/NN or/CC by/IN the/DT motion/NN of/IN 
metal/NN disks,/NN as/IN in/IN the/DT tambourines/NNS and/CC cymbals./CD 
266./CD Stringed/NNP Instruments./NNP If/IN the/DT lid/NN of/IN a/DT piano/NN is/VBZ opened,/VBG numerous/JJ 
wires/NNS are/VBP seen/VBN within;/VBG some/DT long,/VBG some/DT short,/VBG some/DT coarse,/VBG some/DT fine./CD 
Beneath/IN each/DT wire/NN is/VBZ a/DT small/JJ felt/VBN hammer/NN connected/VBN with/IN the/DT keys/NNS in/IN 
such/JJ a/DT way/NN that/IN when/WRB a/DT key/NN is/VBZ pressed,/VBG a/DT string/NN is/VBZ struck/VBN by/IN a/DT hammer/NN 
and/CC is/VBZ thrown/VBN into/IN vibration,/NN thereby/RB producing/VBG a/DT tone./JJ 
If/IN we/PRP press/VBP the/DT lowest/JJS key,/VBG that/DT is,/VBG the/DT key/JJ giving/NN forth/RB the/DT lowest/JJS 
pitch,/NN we/PRP see/VBP that/IN the/DT longest/JJS wire/NN is/VBZ struck/VBN and/CC set/VBN into/IN vibration;/NN 
if/IN we/PRP press/VBP the/DT highest/JJS key,/VBG that/DT is,/VBG the/DT key/JJ giving/VBG the/DT highest/JJS 
pitch,/NN we/PRP see/VBP that/IN the/DT shortest/JJS wire/NN is/VBZ struck./JJ In/IN addition,/NN it/PRP is/VBZ 
seen/VBN that/IN the/DT short/JJ wires/NNS which/WDT produce/VBP the/DT high/JJ tones/NNS are/VBP fine,/VBG 
while/IN the/DT long/JJ wires/NNS which/WDT produce/VBP the/DT low/JJ tones/NNS are/VBP coarse./CD The/DT

==========/NN 
The/DT constant/JJ striking/JJ of/IN the/DT hammers/NNS against/IN the/DT strings/NNS stretches/NNS and/CC 
loosens/VBZ them/PRP and/CC alters/VBZ their/PRP$ pitch;/NN for/IN this/DT reason/NN each/DT string/NN is/VBZ 
fastened/VBN to/TO a/DT screw/NN which/WDT can/MD be/VB turned/VBN so/RB as/IN to/TO tighten/VB the/DT string/NN or/CC 
to/TO loosen/VB it/PRP if/IN necessary./CD The/DT tuning/NN of/IN the/DT piano/NN is/VBZ the/DT adjustment/NN 
of/IN the/DT strings/NNS so/RB that/IN each/DT shall/MD produce/VB a/DT tone/NN of/IN the/DT right/NN pitch./JJ 
When/WRB the/DT strings/NNS are/VBP tightened,/VBG the/DT pitch/NN rises;/NN when/WRB the/DT strings/NNS are/VBP 
loosened,/VBG the/DT pitch/NN falls./CD 
What/WP has/VBZ been/VBN said/VBD of/IN the/DT piano/NN applies/VBZ as/IN well/RB to/TO the/DT violin,/NN guitar,/NN

generally/RB four,/VBP as/IN against/IN eighty-eight/JJ in/IN the/DT piano;/VBG the/DT hammer/NN of/IN 
the/DT piano/NN is/VBZ replaced/VBN in/IN the/DT violin/NN by/IN the/DT bow,/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT guitar/NN by/IN 
the/DT fingers;/NN varying/VBG pitches/NNS on/IN any/DT one/CD string/NN are/VBP obtained/VBN by/IN sliding/VBG 
a/DT finger/NN of/IN the/DT left/VBN hand/NN along/IN the/DT wire,/NN and/CC thus/RB altering/VBG its/PRP$ 
length./JJ 
Frequent/JJ tuning/NN is/VBZ necessary,/VBG because/IN the/DT fine/JJ adjustments/NNS are/VBP easily/RB 
disturbed./VBD The/DT piano/NN is/VBZ the/DT best/RBS protected/VBN of/IN all/PDT the/DT stringed/JJ

produced./VBD This/DT movable/JJ bridge/NN corresponds/VBZ to/TO the/DT finger/NN of/IN the/DT 
violinist;/VBG the/DT finger/NN slides/NNS back/RB and/CC forth/RB along/IN the/DT string,/NN thus/RB 
changing/VBG the/DT length/NN of/IN the/DT bowed/VBN portion/NN and/CC producing/VBG variations/NNS in/IN 
pitch./JJ 
[Illustration:/NNP FIG./NNP 181.--The/CD length/NN of/IN a/DT string/NN influences/VBZ the/DT

[Illustration:/NNP FIG./NNP 182.--Only/JJ one/CD half/NN of/IN the/DT string/NN is/VBZ bowed,/VBG but/CC

268./CD The/DT Freedom/NNP of/IN a/DT String./NNP Some/DT stringed/JJ instruments/NNS give/VBP forth/RB 
tones/NNS which/WDT are/VBP clear/JJ and/CC sweet,/NN but/CC withal/IN thin/JJ and/CC lacking/VBG in/IN 
richness/NN and/CC fullness./CD The/DT tones/NNS sounded/VBN by/IN two/CD different/JJ strings/NNS may/MD 
agree/VB in/IN pitch/NN and/CC loudness/NN and/CC yet/RB produce/VB quite/RB different/JJ effects/NNS on/IN 
the/DT ear,/NN because/IN in/IN one/CD case/NN the/DT tone/NN may/MD be/VB much/RB more/RBR pleasing/JJ than/IN 
in/IN the/DT other./NN The/DT explanation/NN of/IN this/DT is,/NN that/IN a/DT string/NN may/MD vibrate/VB in/IN 
a/DT number/NN of/IN different/JJ ways./CD 
Touch/NNP the/DT middle/NN of/IN a/DT wire/NN with/IN the/DT finger/NN or/CC a/DT pencil/NN (Fig./CD 182),/CD 
thus/RB separating/VBG it/PRP into/IN two/CD portions/NNS and/CC draw/VB a/DT violin/NN bow/NN across/IN the/DT 
center/NN of/IN either/DT half./CD Only/RB one/CD half/NN of/IN the/DT entire/JJ string/NN is/VBZ struck,/VBG 
but/CC the/DT motion/NN of/IN this/DT half/NN is/VBZ imparted/VBN to/TO the/DT other/JJ half/NN and/CC throws/VBZ 
it/PRP into/IN similar/JJ motion,/NN and/CC if/IN a/DT tiny/JJ A-shaped/JJ piece/NN of/IN paper/NN or/CC rider/NN

[Illustration:/NNP FIG./NNP 183.--The/CD string/NN vibrates/VBZ in/IN three/CD portions.]/JJ 
If/IN the/DT wire/NN is/VBZ touched/VBN at/IN a/DT distance/NN of/IN one/CD third/JJ its/PRP$ length/NN and/CC a/DT bow/NN 
is/VBZ drawn/VBN across/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN the/DT smaller/JJR portion,/VBG the/DT string/NN will/MD 
vibrate/VB in/IN three/CD parts;/NN we/PRP cannot/MD always/RB see/VB these/DT various/JJ motions/NNS in/IN 
different/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT string,/NN but/CC we/PRP know/VBP of/IN their/PRP$ existence/NN through/IN 
the/DT action/NN of/IN the/DT riders./JJ 
Similarly,/NNP touching/VBG the/DT wire/NN one/CD fourth/JJ of/IN its/PRP$ length/NN from/IN an/DT end/NN 
makes/VBZ it/PRP vibrate/VB in/IN four/CD segments;/NN touching/VBG it/PRP one/CD fifth/NN of/IN its/PRP$ length/NN 
makes/VBZ it/PRP vibrate/VB in/IN five/CD segments./JJ 
In/IN the/DT first/JJ case,/VBG the/DT string/NN vibrated/VBD as/IN a/DT whole/JJ string/NN and/CC also/RB as/IN 
two/CD strings/NNS of/IN half/PDT the/DT length;/NN hence,/NN three/CD tones/NNS must/MD have/VB been/VBN 
given/VBN out,/NN one/CD tone/NN due/JJ to/TO the/DT entire/JJ string/NN and/CC two/CD tones/NNS due/JJ to/TO the/DT 
segments./JJ But/CC we/PRP saw/VBD in/IN Section/NN 267/CD that/IN halving/VBG the/DT length/NN of/IN a/DT 
string/NN doubles/VBZ the/DT pitch/NN of/IN the/DT resulting/VBG tone,/NN and/CC produces/VBZ the/DT 
octave/JJ of/IN the/DT original/JJ tone;/NN hence/RB a/DT string/NN vibrating/VBG as/IN in/IN Figure/NN 183/CD 
gives/VBZ forth/RB three/CD tones,/NN one/CD of/IN which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT fundamental/JJ tone/NN of/IN the/DT 
string,/NN and/CC two/CD of/IN which/WDT are/VBP the/DT octave/JJ of/IN the/DT fundamental/JJ tone./JJ 
Hence,/NNP the/DT vibrating/VBG string/NN produces/VBZ two/CD sensations,/NN that/DT of/IN the/DT 
fundamental/JJ note/NN and/CC of/IN its/PRP$ octave./JJ 
[Illustration:/NNP FIG./NNP 184.--When/CD a/DT string/NN vibrates/VBZ as/IN a/DT whole,/NN it/PRP gives/VBZ

When/WRB a/DT string/NN is/VBZ plucked/VBN in/IN the/DT middle/NN without/IN being/VBG held,/NN it/PRP vibrates/VBZ 
simply/RB as/IN a/DT whole/JJ (Fig./CD 184),/CD and/CC gives/VBZ forth/RB but/CC one/CD note;/VBG this/DT is/VBZ
