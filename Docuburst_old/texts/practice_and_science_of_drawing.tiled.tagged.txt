PREFACE/NNP 
Permit/VB me/PRP in/IN the/DT first/JJ place/NN to/TO anticipate/VB the/DT disappointment/NN of/IN any/DT 
student/NN who/WP opens/VBZ this/DT book/NN with/IN the/DT idea/NN of/IN finding/VBG "wrinkles"/NN on/IN how/WRB 
to/TO draw/VB faces,/NN trees,/NN clouds,/NN or/CC what/WP not,/VBG short/JJ cuts/NNS to/TO excellence/NN in/IN 
drawing,/NN or/CC any/DT of/IN the/DT tricks/NNS so/RB popular/JJ with/IN the/DT drawing/VBG masters/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ 
grandmothers/NNS and/CC still/RB dearly/RB loved/VBN by/IN a/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN people./CD No/DT good/JJ 
can/MD come/VB of/IN such/JJ methods,/NN for/IN there/EX are/VBP no/DT short/JJ cuts/NNS to/TO excellence./CD But/CC 
help/VB of/IN a/DT very/RB practical/JJ kind/NN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT aim/NN of/IN the/DT following/VBG pages/NNS to/TO 
give;/NN although/IN it/PRP may/MD be/VB necessary/JJ to/TO make/VB a/DT greater/JJR call/NN upon/IN the/DT 
intelligence/NN of/IN the/DT student/NN than/IN these/DT Victorian/JJ methods/NNS attempted./JJ 
It/PRP was/VBD not/RB until/IN some/DT time/NN after/IN having/VBG passed/VBN through/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN 
==========/NN 
training/NN in/IN two/CD of/IN our/PRP$ chief/JJ schools/NNS of/IN art/NN that/IN the/DT author/NN got/VBD any/DT idea/NN 
of/IN what/WP drawing/VBG really/RB meant./JJ What/WP was/VBD taught/VBN was/VBD the/DT faithful/JJ copying/NN 
of/IN a/DT series/NN of/IN objects,/NN beginning/VBG with/IN the/DT simplest/JJS forms,/NN such/JJ as/IN 
cubes,/NN cones,/NN cylinders,/NN &c./CD (an/NN excellent/JJ system/NN to/TO begin/VB with/IN at/IN 
present/JJ in/IN danger/NN of/IN some/DT neglect),/NN after/IN which/WDT more/RBR complicated/VBN objects/NNS 
in/IN plaster/NN of/IN Paris/NNP were/VBD attempted,/NN and/CC finally/RB copies/NNS of/IN the/DT human/JJ head/NN 
and/CC figure/NN posed/VBN in/IN suspended/VBN animation/NN and/CC supported/VBN by/IN blocks,/NN &c./CD In/IN 
so/RB far/RB as/IN this/DT was/VBD accurately/RB done,/VBG all/PDT this/DT mechanical/JJ training/NN of/IN eye/NN 
and/CC hand/NN was/VBD excellent;/VBG but/CC it/PRP was/VBD not/RB enough./CD And/CC when/WRB with/IN an/DT eye/NN 
trained/VBN to/TO the/DT closest/JJS mechanical/JJ accuracy/NN the/DT author/NN visited/VBD the/DT 
galleries/NNS of/IN the/DT Continent/NN and/CC studied/VBD the/DT drawings/NNS of/IN the/DT old/JJ masters,/NN 
it/PRP soon/RB became/VBD apparent/JJ that/IN either/DT his/PRP$ or/CC their/PRP$ ideas/NNS of/IN drawing/VBG were/VBD 
all/DT wrong./CD Very/RB few/JJ drawings/NNS could/MD be/VB found/VBN sufficiently/RB "like/VBG the/DT 
model"/NN to/TO obtain/VB the/DT prize/NN at/IN either/DT of/IN the/DT great/JJ schools/NNS he/PRP had/VBD 
attended./JJ Luckily/RB there/EX was/VBD just/RB enough/JJ modesty/NN left/VBN for/IN him/PRP to/TO realise/VB 
that/IN possibly/RB they/PRP were/VBD in/IN some/DT mysterious/JJ way/NN right/NN and/CC his/PRP$ own/JJ 
training/NN in/IN some/DT way/NN lacking./CD And/CC so/IN he/PRP set/VBD to/TO work/VB to/TO try/VB and/CC climb/VB the/DT 
long/JJ uphill/JJ road/NN that/WDT separates/VBZ mechanically/RB accurate/JJ drawing/NN from/IN 
artistically/RB accurate/JJ drawing./JJ 
Now/RB this/DT journey/NN should/MD have/VB been/VBN commenced/VBN much/JJ earlier,/NN and/CC perhaps/RB it/PRP 
was/VBD due/JJ to/TO his/PRP$ own/JJ stupidity/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD not;/VBG but/CC it/PRP was/VBD with/IN a/DT vague/JJ 
idea/NN of/IN saving/VBG some/DT students/NNS from/IN such/JJ wrong-headedness,/JJ and/CC possibly/RB 
straightening/VBG out/RP some/DT of/IN the/DT path,/NN that/IN he/PRP accepted/VBD the/DT invitation/NN to/TO 
write/VB this/DT book./CD 
In/IN writing/VBG upon/IN any/DT matter/NN of/IN experience,/NN such/JJ as/IN art,/VBG the/DT possibilities/NNS 
of/IN misunderstanding/NN are/VBP enormous,/VBG and/CC one/CD shudders/NNS to/TO think/VB of/IN the/DT 
==========/NN 
things/NNS that/WDT may/MD be/VB put/VBN down/RB to/TO one's/NNS credit,/VBP owing/JJ to/TO such/JJ 
misunderstandings./JJ It/PRP is/VBZ like/IN writing/VBG about/IN the/DT taste/NN of/IN sugar,/NN you/PRP are/VBP 
only/RB likely/JJ to/TO be/VB understood/VBN by/IN those/DT who/WP have/VBP already/RB experienced/VBN the/DT 
flavour;/NN by/IN those/DT who/WP have/VBP not,/VBG the/DT wildest/JJS interpretation/NN will/MD be/VB put/VBN 
upon/IN your/PRP$ words./VBD The/DT written/VBN word/NN is/VBZ necessarily/RB confined/VBN to/TO the/DT things/NNS 
of/IN the/DT understanding/NN because/IN only/RB the/DT understanding/NN has/VBZ written/VBN 
language;/NN whereas/IN art/NN deals/NNS with/IN ideas/NNS of/IN a/DT different/JJ mental/JJ texture,/NN 
which/WDT words/NNS can/MD only/RB vaguely/RB suggest./NNP However,/NNP there/EX are/VBP a/DT large/JJ number/NN 
of/IN people/NNS who,/VBP although/IN they/PRP cannot/MD be/VB said/VB to/TO have/VB experienced/VBN in/IN a/DT 
full/JJ sense/NN any/DT works/NNS of/IN art,/NN have/VBP undoubtedly/RB the/DT impelling/JJ desire/NN which/WDT 
a/DT little/JJ direction/NN may/MD lead/VB on/IN to/TO a/DT fuller/JJR appreciation./JJ And/CC it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO 
such/JJ that/IN books/NNS on/IN art/NN are/VBP useful./CD So/RB that/IN although/IN this/DT book/NN is/VBZ 
primarily/RB addressed/VBN to/TO working/VBG students,/NN it/PRP is/VBZ hoped/VBN that/IN it/PRP may/MD be/VB of/IN 
interest/NN to/TO that/IN increasing/VBG number/NN of/IN people/NNS who,/VBP tired/VBN with/IN the/DT rush/NN 
and/CC struggle/NN of/IN modern/JJ existence,/NN seek/VB refreshment/NN in/IN artistic/JJ things./JJ 
To/TO many/VB such/JJ in/IN this/DT country/NN modern/JJ art/NN is/VBZ still/RB a/DT closed/VBN book;/VBG its/PRP$ 
point/NN of/IN view/NN is/VBZ so/RB different/JJ from/IN that/DT of/IN the/DT art/NN they/PRP have/VBP been/VBN 
brought/VBN up/IN with,/NN that/IN they/PRP refuse/VBP to/TO have/VB anything/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN it./JJ 
Whereas,/NNS if/IN they/PRP only/RB took/VBD the/DT trouble/NN to/TO find/VB out/RP something/NN of/IN the/DT 
point/NN of/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT modern/JJ artist,/NN they/PRP would/MD discover/VB new/JJ beauties/NNS 
they/PRP little/JJ suspected./JJ 
If/IN anybody/NN looks/VBZ at/IN a/DT picture/NN by/IN Claude/NNP Monet/NNP from/IN the/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN of/IN 
a/DT Raphael,/NNP he/PRP will/MD see/VB nothing/NN but/CC a/DT meaningless/JJ jargon/NN of/IN wild/JJ 
paint-strokes./JJ And/CC if/IN anybody/NN looks/VBZ at/IN a/DT Raphael/NNP from/IN the/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN 
of/IN a/DT Claude/NNP Monet,/NNP he/PRP will,/VBG no/DT doubt,/NN only/RB see/VB hard,/VBG tinny/JJ figures/NNS in/IN a/DT 
setting/VBG devoid/JJ of/IN any/DT of/IN the/DT lovely/JJ atmosphere/NN that/IN always/RB envelops/NNS form/VBP 
seen/VBN in/IN nature./JJ So/RB wide/JJ apart/RB are/VBP some/DT of/IN the/DT points/NNS of/IN view/NN in/IN 
painting./VBN In/IN the/DT treatment/NN of/IN form/NN these/DT differences/NNS in/IN point/NN of/IN view/NN 
make/VB for/IN enormous/JJ variety/NN in/IN the/DT work./CD So/RB that/IN no/DT apology/NN need/NN be/VB made/VBN 
for/IN the/DT large/JJ amount/NN of/IN space/NN occupied/VBN in/IN the/DT following/VBG pages/NNS by/IN what/WP is/VBZ 
usually/RB dismissed/VBD as/IN mere/JJ theory;/NN but/CC what/WP is/VBZ in/IN reality/NN the/DT first/JJ 
essential/NN of/IN any/DT good/JJ practice/NN in/IN drawing./JJ To/TO have/VB a/DT clear/JJ idea/NN of/IN what/WP 
it/PRP is/VBZ you/PRP wish/VBP to/TO do,/VB is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ necessity/NN of/IN any/DT successful/JJ 
performance./CD But/CC our/PRP$ exhibitions/NNS are/VBP full/JJ of/IN works/VBZ that/DT show/NN how/WRB seldom/RB 
this/DT is/VBZ the/DT case/NN in/IN art./NNP Works/NNP showing/VBG much/JJ ingenuity/NN and/CC ability,/NN but/CC 
no/DT artistic/JJ brains;/NN pictures/NNS that/WDT are/VBP little/RB more/JJR than/IN school/NN studies,/NN 
exercises/NNS in/IN the/DT representation/NN of/IN carefully/RB or/CC carelessly/RB arranged/VBN 
objects,/NN but/CC cold/JJ to/TO any/DT artistic/JJ intention./JJ 
At/IN this/DT time/NN particularly/RB some/DT principles,/NN and/CC a/DT clear/JJ intellectual/JJ 
understanding/NN of/IN what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ you/PRP are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO do,/VB are/VBP needed./JJ We/PRP have/VBP no/DT 
==========/NN 
set/VBN traditions/NNS to/TO guide/VB us./CD The/DT times/NNS when/WRB the/DT student/NN accepted/VBD the/DT 
style/NN and/CC traditions/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ master/NN and/CC blindly/RB followed/VBD them/PRP until/IN he/PRP 
found/VBD himself,/NN are/VBP gone./CD Such/JJ conditions/NNS belonged/VBD to/TO an/DT age/NN when/WRB 
intercommunication/NN was/VBD difficult,/VBG and/CC when/WRB the/DT artistic/JJ horizon/NN was/VBD 
restricted/VBN to/TO a/DT single/JJ town/NN or/CC province./CD Science/NNP has/VBZ altered/VBN all/DT that,/NN 
and/CC we/PRP may/MD regret/VB the/DT loss/NN of/IN local/JJ colour/NN and/CC singleness/NN of/IN aim/NN this/DT

such/JJ conditions/NNS will/MD occur/VB again./CD Quick/NNP means/NNS of/IN transit/NN and/CC cheap/JJ

museums/NNS and/CC loan/NN exhibitions,/NN or/CC from/IN excellent/JJ photographic/JJ

Japan,/NNP is/VBZ part/NN of/IN the/DT formative/JJ influence/NN by/IN which/WDT he/PRP is/VBZ surrounded;/VBG not/RB 
to/TO mention/VB the/DT modern/JJ science/NN of/IN light/NN and/CC colour/NN that/WDT has/VBZ had/VBN such/JJ an/DT

and/CC a/DT clear/JJ understanding/NN of/IN the/DT science/NN of/IN his/PRP$ art,/NN if/IN he/PRP would/MD select/VB

==========/NN 
The/DT position/NN of/IN art/NN to-day/NN is/VBZ like/IN that/DT of/IN a/DT river/NN where/WRB many/JJ

are/VBP acting/VBG and/CC reacting/VBG upon/IN each/DT other,/NN and/CC art/NN is/VBZ losing/VBG its/PRP$ national/JJ

answering/VBG to/TO the/DT altered/VBN conditions/NNS of/IN humanity,/NN will/MD result./VB 
There/EX are/VBP those/DT who/WP would/MD leave/VB this/DT scene/NN of/IN struggling/VBG influences/NNS and/CC 
away/RB up/IN on/IN some/DT bare/JJ primitive/JJ mountain-top/JJ start/NN a/DT new/JJ stream,/NN begin/VB

It/PRP will/MD perhaps/RB be/VB as/IN well/RB to/TO illustrate/VB a/DT few/NN of/IN the/DT different/JJ brush/NN

Try/VB and/CC see/VB in/IN your/PRP$ mind's/NNS eye/NN the/DT drawing/VBG you/PRP mean/VBP to/TO do,/VB and/CC then/RB try/VB
